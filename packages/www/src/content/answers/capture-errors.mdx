## The Problem

You have a single page JavaScript application, and unlike your API server, the client-side application doesn't generate error logs.

## The Solution

A good starter practice is to instrument your application using **try…catch** statements. This allows you to gracefully handle the error and show a message to the user:

```html
<div id="page"></div>

<script>
  try {
    renderPage();
  } catch (err) {
    document.getElementById('page').innerHTML =
      'An error occurred: ' + err.message;
  }
</script>
```

### Reporting JavaScript Errors

Now, while this pattern will help you create a better user experience, it still doesn't inform you about these kinds of events. A minor change can be made to greatly improve this abstraction:

```html
<script>
  function logError(err) {
    // send the error to our reporting server
    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://example.com/report-js-error',
      method: 'POST',
      data: {
        message: err.message,
        stack: err.stack,
      },
    });
    // for debug purposes, also capture it to console
    console && console.log(err);
  }

  try {
    renderPage();
  } catch (err) {
    logError(err);
    document.getElementById('page').innerHTML =
      'An error occurred. Dont worry though, weve ' +
      'been alerted and are working on a solution';
  }
</script>
```

### Uncaught Exceptions

We're able to gracefully handle page rendering errors, but what about the rest of our application? This is where [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) fits into place. Sentry takes care of automatically instrumenting the JavaScript stack and sends errors to the reporting server. By using Sentry you can avoid the `try…catch` pattern.

Integrating the JavaScript SDK is just a few lines of code:

```html
<script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/<VERSION>/bundle.min.js"></script>
```

Configure your DSN:

```html
Sentry.init({ dsn: 'https://<key>@sentry.io/<project>' });
```

That's it! Sentry takes care of the problem and gets out of your way.
