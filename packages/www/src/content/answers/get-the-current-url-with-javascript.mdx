## The Problem

You want to get the current website URL on a page. How do you do this?

## The Solution

There are multiple ways to get the current URL using JavaScript. Technically, we'll use [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), which are not a part of the JavaScript language but are used with JavaScript. You can use the globally scoped [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) and [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) web API interfaces to get the current URL in a browser.

The `Window` interface represents a window containing a [`DOM`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) document. It has a `document` property that points to the [DOM `Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) loaded in the window. This is the `Document` interface that represents the [`DOM tree`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Using_the_W3C_DOM_Level_1_Core#what_is_a_dom_tree) of a loaded web page in the browser.

The [`window.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) and [`document.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/location) (which is the same as `window.document.location`) properties are read-only and return a [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location) object. This object contains information about the current URL, including the following properties:

```json
{
    "ancestorOrigins": {},
    "href": "https://sentry.io/answers/capture-errors/",
    "origin": "https://sentry.io",
    "protocol": "https:",
    "host": "sentry.io",
    "hostname": "sentry.io",
    "port": "",
    "pathname": "/answers/capture-errors/",
    "search": "",
    "hash": ""
}
```

To get the current URL, get the `href` property value:

```javascript
window.location.href // 'https://sentry.io/answers/capture-errors/'
// or
document.location.href // 'https://sentry.io/answers/capture-errors/'
```

You can also get the values of the following properties on the `window` object to get the current URL:

```javascript
document.URL // 'https://sentry.io/answers/capture-errors/'
document.documentURI // 'https://sentry.io/answers/capture-errors/'
```

If you need to parse the URL, you can create a [`URL` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) with the current URL. It has useful methods for parsing a URL, for example, you can get search parameter values by their names:

```javascript
const urlObj = new URL(window.location.href);
console.log(urlObj.href) // https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cat?order_by=latest&orientation=landscape&color=yellow
console.log(urlObj.searchParams.get('color')); // yellow
```

The `URL` interface is also used to construct, normalize, and encode URLs.
