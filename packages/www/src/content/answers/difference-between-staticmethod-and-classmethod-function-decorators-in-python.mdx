## The Problem

What is the difference between a function decorated with `@staticmethod` and one decorated with `@classmethod` in Python?

## The Solution

Python programmers who have used classes will know that standard methods inside a class receive the called instance as their first argument. This is conventionally called `self` and must be specified as a parameter, per the [Python principle](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) that "explicit is better than implicit". The following code snippet shows an example of this:

```python
class Greeter:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")


alice = Greeter("Alice")
alice.say_hello()  # will print "Hello, my name is Alice."
```

Functions decorated by `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod` provide alternatives to this behavior. We can decorate a function with `@staticmethod` to prevent Python from passing an instance of the object to it, as below.

```python
class Greeter:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @staticmethod
    def say_hello_static(name):  # <-- no self parameter
        print(f"Hello {name}, how are you?")


alice = Greeter("Alice")
alice.say_hello_static("Bob")  # will print "Hello Bob, how are you?"
```

This can be useful when we have functionality that logically belongs in a given class, but does not do anything with the instance it's called on.

By contrast, the `@classmethod` decorator will make Python pass the *class* of the instance it's called on as the first argument. By convention, the first parameter of a class method is called `cls`. Class methods can also be called on classes directly.

```python
class Greeter:

    @classmethod
    def say_hello_class(cls):  # <-- cls instead of self
        print(f"Hello, I am a {cls.__name__}.")


Greeter.say_hello_class()  # will print "Hello, I am a Greeter."

alice = Greeter()
alice.say_hello_class()  # will print "Hello, I am a Greeter."
```

Class methods are useful when we want to define behaviors that affect a class as a whole, rather than single instances. A common use case is creating [factory methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern).
