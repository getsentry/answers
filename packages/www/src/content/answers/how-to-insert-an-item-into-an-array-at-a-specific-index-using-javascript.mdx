## The Problem

You want to insert an item into an array at a specific index. For example, inserting an item at a specific index in a to-do list.

## The Solution

There are various methods to insert an item into an array, broadly divided into those that change the original array and those that don't.

### Using the `splice()` Method

The [`splice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) method is used to change an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements. This method modifies the original array.

```javascript
const arr = ["walk the dog", "go shopping", "exercise"];
const index = 2;
const value = "go to the pharmacy";
arr.splice(index, 0, value);
console.log(arr); // "walk the dog", "go shopping", "go to the pharmacy", "exercise"
```

The first argument of the `splice()` method is the `start` index, which is the index at which to start changing the array. This is the only required argument. The second argument is the `deleteCount`. To add elements to an array, add each element as an additional argument. The `splice()` method returns an array of the deleted elements. If no elements are deleted, an empty array is returned.

If you are dealing with very large arrays, the `splice()` method is most likely to perform the best as it does not need to create a new array, unlike the other methods that are described below.

If you don't want to modify the original array, you can also make a copy of the array before using the `splice()` method:

```javascript
const arr = ["walk the dog", "go shopping", "exercise"];
const arrCopy = [...arr];
const index = 2;
const value = "go to the pharmacy";
arrCopy.splice(index, 0, value);
console.log(arrCopy); // "walk the dog", "go shopping", "go to the pharmacy", "exercise"
```

### Using the `slice()` Method

The [`slice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method selects a portion of an array and returns a [shallow copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy) of it. It does not modify the original array.

The `slice()` method has two optional arguments: The `start` argument is the zero-based index at which to start selecting a portion of the array. The `end` argument is the zero-based index at which to stop selecting a portion of the array. The `slice()` method extracts up to the `end` argument index, it does not include the array element at the `end` index.

The `slice()` method can be used along with [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to insert an item into an array at a specific index:

```javascript
const arr = ["walk the dog", "go shopping", "exercise"];
const index = 2;
const value = "go to the pharmacy";
const newArr = [...arr.slice(0, index), value, ...arr.slice(index, arr.length)];
console.log(newArr); // "walk the dog", "go shopping", "go to the pharmacy", "exercise"
```

### Using a Loop

You can also use a for loop to loop through each item in an array, add each item to a new array, and insert an item at a specific index:

```javascript
const arr = ["walk the dog", "go shopping", "exercise"];
const index = 2;
const value = "go to the pharmacy";
const newArr = [];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  if (i === index) {
    newArr.push(value);
  }
  newArr.push(arr[i]);
}

console.log(newArr); // "walk the dog", "go shopping", "go to the pharmacy", "exercise"
```

### Using `reduce()`

You can create a custom function that uses [`reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) to insert an element into an array at a specific index:

```javascript
const arr = ["walk the dog", "go shopping", "exercise"];
const index = 2;
const value = "go to the pharmacy";

function insert(array, val, ind) {
  return ind >= arr.length
    ? array.concat(val)
    : array.reduce(
      (accumulator, currentValue, i) => accumulator.concat(i === ind ? [val, currentValue] : currentValue),
      [],
    );
}

console.log(insert(arr, value, index)); // "walk the dog", "go shopping", "go to the pharmacy", "exercise"
```

This method creates a new array; it does not change the original array.
