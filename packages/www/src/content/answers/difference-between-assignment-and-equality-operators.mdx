## The Problem

People who are new to programming often find it difficult to understand the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`.

In mathematics we only use `=`, so what do the other two mean?

## The Solution

The `=` is an assignment operator, while `==` and `===` are called equality operators.

### Assignment Operator (`=`)

In mathematics and algebra, `=` is an **equal to** operator. In programming `=` is an [assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment), which means that it assigns a value to a variable.

For example, the following code will store a value of `5` in the variable `x`:

```javascript
let x; // declaring a variable.

x = 5; // assigning a value of 5 to the variable.
```

We can combine the declaration and assignment in one line:

```javascript
let y = 10;
```

It may look like the assignment operator works the same way as algebra's **equal to** operator, but that's not the case.

For example, the following doesn't make any sense in algebra:

```javascript
x = x + 4;
```

But it is acceptable in JavaScript (and other programming languages). JavaScript will take the expression on the right-hand side of the operator `x + 4` and store this value in `x` again.

### Equality Operator (`==`)

In JavaScript, the operator that compares two values is written like this: `==`. It is called an [equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality). The equality operator is one of the many [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators) in JavaScript that are used in logical and conditional statements.

The equality operator returns `true` or `false` based on whether the operands (the values being compared) are equal.

For example, the following code will return `false`:

```javascript
let x = 5; // declares x and assigns x to the value 5
x == 8; // returns false
```

Interestingly, if we compare an integer `5` and a string `"5"` it returns `true`.

```javascript
5 == "5"; // returns true
```

That is because in most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for comparison. **This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically.**

### Strict Equality Operator (`===`)

Like the equality operator above, the [strict equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) compares the two values. But unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator compares both the **content** and the **type** of the operands.

So using the strict equality operator, `5` and `"5"` are not equal.

```javascript
5 === "5"; // returns false
```

It is better to use the strict equality operator to prevent type conversions, which may result in unexpected bugs. But if youâ€™re certain the types on both sides will be the same, there is no problem with using the shorter operator.
