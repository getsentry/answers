## The Problem

When configuring Postgres initially, this error is quite common: `psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "<your host>" and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432`. It occurs because Postgres isn't listening on the correct port (5432 is what `psql` expects by default) or there is an issue connecting from your computer to that port.

## The Solution

First, double check that the Postgres process is running where you expect it to be. If you are trying to connect to a Postgres instance on the same host as your terminal, you can run `lsof -p :5432` which will show which, if any, processes are listening on that port. The postgres process should be connected there.

You can also look at the `listen_address` and `port` value in your `postgresql.conf` to make sure Postgres is accepting connections on the address and port you expect. If the connection is still failing, then there might be a permission issue in the `pg_hba.conf` access configuration file. Make sure this is set up correctly to accept connections from your IP. Finally, ensure there are no firewalls or `iptables` on the Postgres server that are blocking connections.
