## The Problem

Using libraries like [Flagr](https://openflagr.github.io/flagr) to help maintain feature flags 
had a negative performance impact; it was taking 900ms to only check 50 flags.

![Flagr took 900ms to check 50 flags, 500ms specifically on evaluation](feature-flag-flagr-900-500.png)

Using Sentry performance monitoring, we discovered the majority of the time was 
spent deserializing the Flagr response.  

## The Solution

Digging into the client, we noticed that deserialization was turning the entire 
JSON blob (i.e. the flag results) into a Python object. While deserializing JSON 
is convenient from a development perspective, because we were only using a few 
JSON fields, the cost just wasn’t worth it. 

After removing caching and patching our own deserializer with a simple 
json.loads(response.data) we saw a huge improvement in speed — so much so that 
other areas began to look slow by comparison:
