## The Problem

When getting started with Postgres, you might come across this error: `psql: FATAL: database "root" does not exist` or `psql: FATAL: database "<your user name>" does not exist`. This can happen particularly when running `psql` with no arguments from your command line. The issue is that if you specify no arguments, psql assumes you want to access a database with the same name as your user name.

## The Solution

If you are just setting up Postgres for the first time, you will need to use the `postgres` user to configure your database initially. Either do `su - postgres` in your command line to switch to that user, or log in as the postgres user on your computer.

Once you have the database set up, you can use the `-d` option to the `psql` command or append the database name after all the other `psql` options, e.g. `psql -H myhost database`.
