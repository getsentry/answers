## The Problem

How to access a return value from an asynchronous function call in JavaScript?

## The Solution

In modern JavaScript, we can use [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) when calling asynchronous functions to pause the execution of the current function until a value is returned. This allows us to write and reason about asynchronous code as if it were synchronous.

The code below provides an example:

```javascript
async function asyncHelloWorld() {
  return "Hello world!";
}

async function asyncCaller() {
  const result = await asyncHelloWorld();
  console.log(result); // will print "Hello world!"
}

asyncCaller();
```

Note that `await` can only be called from within asynchronous functions or top-level code inside a [module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
