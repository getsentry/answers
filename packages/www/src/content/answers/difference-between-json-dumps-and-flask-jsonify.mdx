## The Problem

What is the difference between `json.dumps()` and `flask.jsonify()` and when should you use which?

## The Solution

The [`jsonify()`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/api/#flask.json.jsonify) function is a part of the Flask framework whereas [`json.dumps()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) is a method in the built-in `json` package in Python.

### The `json.dumps()` Method

If you are reading or writing JSON data from files, or in local memory, you should use the `json` package.

The `json` package offers many methods, including the `json.dumps()` method, to interchange Python data with JSON.

The `json.dumps()` method turns Python data, including dictionaries and lists, into JSON and returns this JSON as a string. For example:

```python
import json

books = [
  {'name': 'The Call of the Wild', 'author':'Jack London'},
  {'name': 'Heart of Darkness', 'author': 'Joseph Conrad'}
]

json_string = json.dumps(books)
print(json_string)
```

If we run the above code we will get the following output:

```
[{"name": "The Call of the Wild", "author": "Jack London"}, {"name": "Heart of Darkness", "author": "Joseph Conrad"}]
```

### The `flask.jsonify()` Function

If you are using the Flask framework and want to send some data as an HTTP response, you should use the `flask.jsonify()` function.

The `flask.jsonify()` function returns a Response object. Flask serializes your data as JSON and adds it to this Response object. It also adds the appropriate mimetype by setting the `content-type` header field to `application/json`.

For example, if we want to return the list of books from the example above as an API response using Flask, we can write the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/books')
def list_of_books():
    books = [
        {'name': 'The Call of the Wild', 'author': 'Jack London'},
        {'name': 'Heart of Darkness', 'author': 'Joseph Conrad'}
    ]
    return jsonify(books)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

When we call the `'/books'` endpoint using curl, we get the following JSON data:

```json
[
  {
    "author": "Jack London",
    "name": "The Call of the Wild"
  },
  {
    "author": "Joseph Conrad",
    "name": "Heart of Darkness"
  }
]
```
