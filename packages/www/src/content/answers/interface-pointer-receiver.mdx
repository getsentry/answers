## The Problem

The error:
./prog.go:23:7: cannot use b (type Bar) as type Foo in argument to Fizzy: Bar does not implement Foo (Fizz method has pointer receiver)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Foo interface {
	Fizz()
}

type Bar struct {}

func (b *Bar) Fizz() {
	fmt.Println("fizz")
}

func Fizzy(foo Foo) {
	foo.Fizz()
}

func main() {
	b := Bar{}
	Fizzy(b)
}
```

## The Solution

This error happens because the pointer to a type is its own unique type. In this example, `*Bar` is a different type to `Bar`. The method receiver `Fizz` is defined on the `*Bar` type, not the `Bar` type. So only `*Bar` satisfies the interface `Foo`.

The fix:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Foo interface {
	Fizz()
}

type Bar struct {}

func (b *Bar) Fizz() {
	fmt.Println("fizz")
}

func Fizzy(foo Foo) {
	foo.Fizz()
}

func main() {
	b := &Bar{}
	Fizzy(b)
}
```

Change `b` to a pointer to a `Bar`. Since `*Bar` satisfies the interface `Foo`, `b` can now be used as a function argument to `Fizzy`.
