## The Problem

You have an object with several properties and you want to remove some of these properties before using the object further.

```javascript
    let person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        gender: "Male",
        age: 34
    };

    const json = JSON.stringify(person);
    console.log(json);
    // => {"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","gender":"Male","age":34}
    // What can we do if we don't want the `age` property in the JSON string? -->
```

Here the JSON string also contains the `age` property. However, you will be sending the string over the network, and the server on the other end won't be using the `age` property. So you want to remove the `age` property from the `person` object before converting it to a JSON string.

## The Solution

You can use the `delete` operator, which is simpler, or object destructuring, which can remove more than a single property at a time.

### Using the `delete` operator

Use the `delete` operator to remove a property from an object.

```javascript
    let person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        gender: "Male",
        age: 34
    };

    // Delete the age property first
    delete person.age;
    let json = JSON.stringify(person);
    console.log(json);
```

The `delete` operator will return if it was successful and always returns `true` - even when a property does not exist. The call will only return `false` when a property is non-configurable - which is the case for properties on built-in objects like the `length` of an `Array`.

### Using object destructuring

The `delete` operator can only remove one property per call. So if you want to delete the `age` and `gender` properties, then you have to make two `delete` calls. As an alternative, you can use object destructuring to remove multiple properties with one call.

```javascript
    const person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        gender: "Male",
        age: 34
    };

    // Destructure the age and gender
    const {age, gender, ...personTrimmed} = person;
    const json = JSON.stringify(personTrimmed);
    console.log(json);
```

Note that destructuring is significantly slower than the `delete` operator because it makes a new object copy from the original object. Destructuring is also not supported by any versions of IE.
