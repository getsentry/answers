## The Problem

What does the `on_delete` option do in Django models?

## The Solution

The `on_delete` option determines how the deletion of referenced data will be handled by the database to maintain data integrity.

Let's say we are making a learning management system (LMS). We define the following models:

```python
class Student(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)

class Homework(models.Model):
	title = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

The `Homework` model stores a reference to the student who submitted that homework as a [`ForeignKey`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey). A `ForeignKey` is a many-to-one relationship, which means that every student can submit multiple homework assignments, but each homework assignment can be submitted by only one student.

Let's create an instance of both objects:

```python
# Run these commands in Django shell
student = Student.objects.create(name="Jane")
homework = Homework.objects.create(title="Jane's homework", student=student_1)
```

What happens if we want to delete `homework`? We can do so without any problem as `student` doesn't contain any reference to `homework`. The `student` instance existed before we created `homework` and it can carry on existing after we delete `homework`.

But before we can delete `student`, we have to tell Django what to do with `homework`. Do we want orphaned `homework` instances lying around in our LMS? Or do we need to delete all the `homework` submitted by a student when that student is deleted?

This is where the `on_delete` option is used. It tells Django what behavior to adopt when the referenced object is deleted. We can set `on_delete` to one of seven options. Let's take a look at each option:

### CASCADE

Cascades deletes. When we delete `student`, `homework` will also be deleted.

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# also deletes homework
```

### PROTECT

Prevents deletion of the referenced object. When we try to delete `student`, we will get a [ProtectedError](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/exceptions/#django.db.models.ProtectedError):

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.PROTECT)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Raises ProtectedError. We first need to delete homework before Django will allow us to delete student.

```

### RESTRICT

Prevents deletion of the referenced object. When we try to delete `student`, we will get a [RestrictedError](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/exceptions/#django.db.models.RestrictedError):

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.RESTRICT)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Raises RestrictedError.

```

Unlike `PREVENT`, `RESTRICT` allows deletion of a referenced object if it also references a different object that is being deleted in the same operation, but via a `CASCADE` relationship. To learn more, see the example in [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete).

### SET_NULL

This option sets the `ForeignKey` to `null`, but we have to specify `null=True` in our model.

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Sets the foreign key in homework to null and deletes student.

```

### SET_DEFAULT

This option sets the `ForeignKey` to its default value, but we have to specify a default value in our model.

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.SET_DEFAULT, default=1)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Sets the foreign key in homework to the student whose id is 1, and deletes student.

```

### SET()

This option sets the `ForeignKey` to the value passed to `SET()`

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.SET(get_student))


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Calls the get_student function that you have defined, sets the foreign key in homework to the value returned by the get_student function, and deletes student.

```

### DO_NOTHING

This option makes no changes to the object with the `ForeignKey`. In most cases, `DO_NOTHING` is a bad choice as it can create integrity issues. But some advance level use cases might need this option.

```python
# models.py
class Homework(models.Model):
	...
	student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)


# Django shell
student.delete()

# Deletes student. Makes no changes to homework.

```
