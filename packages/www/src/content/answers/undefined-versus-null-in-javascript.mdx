## The Problem

What is the difference between the values `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?

## The Solution

When a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value, it will have the type and value `undefined`. `undefined` is one of JavaScript's [primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined).

```javascript
let myVar;

console.log(myVar); // will print "undefined"
console.log(typeof myVar); // will also print "undefined"
```

When a variable has not been declared or assigned, it will also be of type `undefined` and throw a [`ReferenceError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined) when accessed. Therefore, `typeof` will produce the same result for declared but undefined variables and undeclared variables.

```javascript
console.log(undeclaredVar); // will throw a ReferenceError
console.log(typeof undeclaredVar); // will print "undefined"
```

In contrast, `null` is a value that represents nothing. Think of `null` as an empty container and `undefined` as the absence of a container. A variable will only have the value `null` when it is explicitly assigned, and will be of type [`object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object).

```javascript
const myVar = null;

console.log(myVar); // will print "null"
console.log(typeof myVar); // will print "object"
```

The difference between `undefined` and `null` is important when using JavaScript's equality operators. `null` and `undefined` are considered the same when using loose equality (`==`) but not when using strict equality (`===`).

```javascript
console.log(undefined == null); // will print "true"
console.log(undefined === null); // will print "false"
```
