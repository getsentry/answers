## The Problem

How do we pass command-line arguments to a Node.js script or program, and how can we access them in Node.js?

## The Solution

Command-line arguments are a great way to provide additional information and/or customization to a Node.js script.

### Passing the Arguments

We can pass any number of command-line arguments while invoking a Node.js application by typing them in after the name of the file, like so:

```powershell
node example.js a b c d
```

Arguments can be standalone or they can be a key-value pair:

```powershell
node example.js letter=a
```

### Retrieving the Arguments

Node.js has a built-in object called `process`. This object exposes an array `argv`, which contains all the arguments passed from the command-line.

But first, let's take a look at what happens when we launch a Node.js process without any arguments.

Let's create a file `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```javascript
process.argv.forEach((value, index) => {
  console.log(index, value);
});
```

When we run the following command:

```powershell
node index.js
```

We get the following output in our terminal:

```powershell
0 \path\to\node.exe
1 \path\to\index.js
```

There are two things to note:

- The array `argv` exists even if we do not pass any additional arguments to our Node.js process.
- The first two elements of this array always contain the path to our node binary and the path to our script.

Let's re-run the script, but this time with some arguments:

```powershell
node index.js one two three env=dev
```

And this time we get:

```powershell
0 \path\to\node.exe
1 \path\to\index.js
2 one
3 two
4 three
5 env=dev
```

In order to get only the additional arguments we can create a new array and exclude the first two elements like so:

```javascript
const arguments = process.argv.slice(2);
arguments.forEach((value, index) => {
  console.log(index, value);
});
```

And we get the following:

```powershell
0 one
1 two
2 three
3 env=dev
```
