## The Problem

The error:
./prog.go:15:10: cannot call pointer method on m["bar"] <br />
./prog.go:15:10: cannot take the address of m["bar"]

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Bar struct {}

func (b *Bar) Fizz() {
	fmt.Println("buzz")
}

func main() {
	m := map[string]Bar{"bar": Bar{}}
	m["bar"].Fizz()
}
```

## The Solution

There are actually two different bugs here, hence the two different compile errors. The first bug is that the function `Fizz` is defined on a pointer receiver `*Bar` and `m` is a map of non-pointer `Bar`. Normally this isn't an issue, because Go will automatically create a pointer to the object and then call `Fizz` on that. However, since map entries are not addressable, Go cannot create a pointer and this error occurs.

The fix:
There are two ways to fix this. The first is to change `m` to type `map[string]*Bar` and then have `&Bar{}` as the value. The other solution shown below is to change the `Fizz` method to not be a pointer receiver.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Bar struct {}

func (b Bar) Fizz() {
	fmt.Println("buzz")
}

func main() {
	m := map[string]Bar{"bar": Bar{}}
	m["bar"].Fizz()
}
```
