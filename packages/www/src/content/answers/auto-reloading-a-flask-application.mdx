## The Problem

You are working on a Flask project and notice that the process of manually reloading your Flask application every time you save new changes is tedious and inefficient.

Is there a way to automatically reload your Flask application whenever you save changes to your code?

## The Solution

Use the `--debug` option when you run your Flask app to enable debug mode.

```bash
flask --app example_app.py --debug run
```

This will enable auto-reload whenever changes are made to your code and saved. It will also enable an interactive debugger in the browser if any errors occur during a request.

For more information about running your Flask app, run the following command to get a list of options:

```bash
flask run --help
```
