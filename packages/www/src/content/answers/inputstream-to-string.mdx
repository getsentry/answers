## The Problem

You're writing some code and are faced with converting some unknown length [`InputStream`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html) containing text to a [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) object in Java.

## The Solution

If you are working with JDK 9 (or later), you are in luck as the [`readAllBytes()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#readAllBytes--) method was added in the [`InputStream`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html) class. This method provides one-line solution to convert an `InputStream` to a `byte` array. The `byte` array can then simply be decoded into a `String` using the `String`'s constructor method. The code below is an example of how to use the `readAllBytes()` method:

```java
public String toString_ReadAllBytes(InputStream stream) throws Exception {

    Byte[] stringBytes = stream.readAllBytes(); // read all bytes into a byte array

    String string = new String(stringBytes); // decodes stringBytes into a String

    return string;
}
```

It should, however, be noted that the Java API documentation states that this method is not intended for use with larger input streams. However, in practice, we found this method should be fast enough for most applicable use cases. With an input stream of around 1.9 gigabytes, it only took a two seconds to execute this conversion. We did not experiment with anything larger as, in Java, the `String` class is based on a 32-bit array and so it cannot be assigned more than two gigabytes of data without throwing an `OutOfMemoryError`.

The equivalent code for Java 8 (or lower) is slightly more complex. Without the `readAllBytes()` method, the most efficient alternative is to make use of a `ByteArrayOutputStream` and using `InputStream.read()` to read chunks of data at a time as shown in the example below:

```java
public String toString_ByteArrayOutputStream(InputStream stream) throws Exception {

    ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

    int readBytes = inputStream.read(buffer);

    // inputStream.read() returns -1 when the end of the stream is reached
    while(readBytes != -1){
        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, readBytes);
        readBytes = inputStream.read(buffer);
    }

    return outputStream.toString();
}
```
We found this method to be very slightly slower than the JDK 9 `readAllBytes()` solution, but still very useable for any size of input streams. Our 1.9 gigabyte input stream processed in around four seconds with this approach compared to the two second execution time achieved by the `readAllBytes()` method.

In conclusion, there are many other ways to create a `String` from an `InputStream` in Java. The above two examples represent the simplest and most efficient of these. If your environment permits later versions of Java (9 or newer), the built in methods provided by the `InputStream` class make it trivial to convert between `InputStream` and `String`. For most situations, this approach has very fast execution and requires little code to get going. Where only older versions of Java are available, the quickest solution is to read the `InputStream` in and then write this data to an `OutputStream` to produce the final String result.
