## The problem

You have an element that you would like to show or hide, for example an element that is shown or hidden when a user clicks a button. How do you conditionally render an element?

## The solution

There are three common ways to conditionally render elements in JSX: using the logical AND (&&) operator, using the conditional (ternary) operator, and using an `if` statement.

### Using the logical AND (&&) operator

You can use the [logical AND (&&) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) to conditionally render an element based on a boolean state value:

```javascript
export default function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  function toggle() {
    setIsOpen((isOpen) => !isOpen);
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {isOpen && <Popup />}
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle show</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example code above, the component `Popup` is initially not shown. When the "Toggle show" button is clicked once, `isOpen` is set to true. `MyComponent` re-renders and the component `Popup` is rendered as a [React element](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html). If the button is clicked again, `isOpen` is set to false and the `Popup` component is not rendered.

The issue with using the `&&` operator is that you may end up unintentionally rendering `0` instead of nothing if the value to the left of the `&&` operator is `0`, which would be the case in the following code if the `items` prop was an array with no items.

```javascript
function ItemList({ items }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {items.length &&
          items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `&&` operator evaluates the values it compares, the operands, from left to right. It returns immediately with the value of the first [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) value it finds. If all values are [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), the last evaluated value is returned. This is why `0` would be displayed if the value of `items.length` is 0. The length of `[]` is 0. You can fix this by making sure that the value is a boolean, for example:

```javascript
!!items.length && ...
// or
items.length > 0 && ...
// or
Boolean(items.length) && ...
```

### Using the conditional (ternary) operator

You can use a [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to conditionally render an element without having to worry about converting values to booleans:

```javascript
function ItemList({ items }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {items.length
          ? items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)
          : null}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using an `if` statement

You can also use an `if` statement instead of a ternary operator if you prefer the syntax:

```javascript
function ItemList({ items }) {
  let itemsElements = null;
  if (items.length) {
    itemsElements = items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>{itemsElements}</ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
