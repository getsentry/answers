## The Problem

When handling form input, the first thing that comes to your mind is using the `useState`
hook to hold the form values. The `useState` hook is a great way to handle form input, but
it comes with a downside. Every time the state changes, the component re-renders. This is
not a problem when you have a small form, but when you have a large form with many input fields,
or you don't neccessarily need to re-render the UI, this can be a performance issue.

## The Solution

The solution is to use the `useRef` hook instead of `useState`. The `useRef` hook is a
great way to store a mutable value that doesn't trigger a re-render. The `useRef` hook
returns an object with a `current` property, which is mutable and can hold any value.

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
```

With this we've created a ref that we can assign to an input field.

```jsx
<input type="text" ref={inputRef} placeholder="Enter your name" />
```

If you notice, the `value` and `onChange` props are missing from the input field. These
inputs are called **uncontrolled inputs**.

To obtain the values from the input field, we can use the `current` property of the ref
whenever we need it, for example in the form handler method:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = () => {
  const name = inputRef.current.value;

  console.log(name); // the value of the input field
};
```

We can do the same for all of the input fields in the form. This way we can avoid re-rendering
the component when the state changes, and we can also avoid using the `onChange` event handler
for each input field.
