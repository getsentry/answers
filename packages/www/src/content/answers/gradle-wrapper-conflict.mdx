```

## The Solution

Your build.gradle file is defining a task with the name wrapper, likely to pin the gradle version, like:

```
task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '5.6.4'
}
```

But you have already the gradle wrapper defined in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file, like:

```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.6.4-all.zip
```

If you have your gradle wrapper checked-in to source control, you can safely remove the wrapper task from the build.gradle file. Otherwise, remove the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file.
