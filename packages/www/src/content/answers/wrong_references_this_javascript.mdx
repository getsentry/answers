## The Problem

The `this` keyword is used in JavaScript to refer to an object. The object it refers to depends on how `this` is being invoked. The following [table](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp) shows the different global and function contexts that `this` can be used:

| Where `this` is called | What it refers to           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Object method          | The object                  |
| Used alone             | The global object           |
| In a function          | The global object           |
| In a function (strict) | `undefined`                 |
| In an event            | The element receiving event |

In light of the above uses of `this`, there are bound to be problems where the `this` keyword ends up referring to the wrong object. We're going to explore how these incorrect references come about and how to fix them.

## The Solution

To understand how wrong references to `this` can occur, let's look at the following code example where `this` is used when working with functions:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}

// returns "[object Window]"
```

In the above example, `this` refers to the global object, which is an open browser window.

In `strict mode`, as shown below, `this` becomes `undefined` because default binding is not allowed. In this case, `this` should be used in objects you created.

```javascript
'use strict';
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}

// returns "undefined"
```

The use of `this` is further explained below in the case of using it inside an object method.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  id: 1,
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

// Outputs "John Doe"
console.log(person.fullName());
```

If you want to output a person's full name, `this` is used and will refer to the `person` object.

However, things can become confusing when you want to use nested functions inside an object:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  id: 1,
  fullName() {
    function name() {
      this.firstName = 'Jane';
      return this;
    }
    const p = name();
    return `${this.firstName} ${p.firstName}`;
  },
};

// Outputs "John Jane"
console.log(person.fullName());
```

The above code outputs the result as expected because of object method binding, where each reference to `this` is bound to the `firstName` of the calling object where:

- `this.firstName` returns "John", and
- `p.firstName` returns "Jane".

However, if we were to modify the return statement for `fullName` to have the following (instead of outputting the `firstName`):

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  id: 1,
  fullName() {
    function name() {
      return this;
    }
    const p = name();
    return `${this} ${p}`;
  },
};

// Outputs [object Object] [object Window]
console.log(person.fullName());
```

You'll notice that the `this` returned inside the `name()` function refers to the `object Window`, which is a global object. Even though `this` is used inside an object, it is still seen as being used alone and inside a function. As such, it refers to the global object.

If we want to bind `this` to any object properties defined inside `name()`, one way is to assign the `this` value from the calling object to another variable that would be used inside the nested function.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  id: 1,
  fullName() {
    const that = this;
    function name() {
      return that;
    }
    return name();
  },
};
```

Furthermore, methods such as `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` can be used to refer `this` to any object.

The code below illustrates the use of the `bind()` method where the `member` object borrows a property from the `person` object. In this case, the `this` keyword refers to the `member` object, so we get the output "Steve Doe".

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  id: 1,
  fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

const member = {
  firstName: 'Steve',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

const p = person.fullName.bind(member);

// Outputs "Steve Doe"
console.log(p());
```
