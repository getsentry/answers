## The Problem

You know that some programming languages make use of a ternary operator to shorten if-else code blocks, but does Python support this kind of syntax? If so, what is the structure of a Python ternary operator?

## The Solution

The ternary operator is used to shorten the code needed to write if-else blocks.

The syntax of ternary operators naturally differs between languages, but in most cases, the operator handles three arguments: the comparison, the result if true, and the result if false.

A normal if-else block takes at least four lines of code. For example, 

```python
if x > y:
  z = x
else:
  z = y
```

The ternary operator lets you shorten an if-else block into a single line of code.

### The Python Ternary Operator

The Python ternary operator follows this syntax:

```python
x if condition else y
```

The operator checks a condition, and returns `x` if the condition is true or `y` if it's not.

Here is an example of a ternary operator use case:

```python
x = 10
y = 5

z = x if x > y else y

print("z = " + str(z))
```

**Output:**

```
z = 10
```

The ternary operator above checks if `x` is greater than `y`, and if it is, assigns the value of `x` (10) to the variable `z`.
