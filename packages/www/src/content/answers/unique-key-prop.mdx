## The Problem

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop
```

```html
<ul>
  {["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"].map(item =>
  <li>{item}</li>
  )}
</ul>
```

## The Solution

When creating a list in the UI from an array with JSX, you should add a `key` prop to each child and to any of its' children.

Ex: `<li key="uniqueId1" >Item1</li>`

React uses the `key` prop create a relationship between the component and the DOM element. The library uses this relationship to determine whether or not the component should be re-rendered.

It is not recommended to use the index of the array as the `key` prop if you know the array will not be static. If the `key` is an index, reordering an item in the array changes it. Then React will get confused and re-render the incorrect element.

Keys do not have to be unique globally. They just need to be unique across sibling elements.

```html
<ul>
  {["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"].map(item =>
  <li key="{item}">{item}</li>
  )}
</ul>
```
