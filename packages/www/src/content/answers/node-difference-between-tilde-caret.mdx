## The Problem

Dependencies in a `package.json` file often contain a tilde (~) or caret (^) sign before the version number. What do these signs mean, and what is the difference between them?

## The Solution

All `npm` packages must adhere to the [Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org/).

So if a package version looks like this `2.1.4`, each of these numbers has a meaning.

### 2.1.`4`

This number refers to a patch release, which means it is a bug fix and is backward compatible.

### 2.`1`.4

This number refers to a minor release, which means new features have been added but it is still backward compatible.

### `2`.1.4

This number refers to a major release, which means that it introduces major changes and may break backward compatibility.

We can specify which releases to accept while updating a package by using special signs in front of the version number in our `package.json` file.

### Using a Tilde (~)

Using a tilde sign before our version number means that we can accept only a patch release when updating our package.

### Using a Caret (^)

Using a caret (^) sign means that we can accept minor releases and patch releases, but not a major release when updating our package.

### Using an Asterisk (*)

Using an asterisk means "accept all releases", but this is not advisable as it will accept major releases and may break our code.

### Example

Let's say we are using the `lodash` package in a project. We currently have version `3.8.0` installed. Lodash announces a new release with version number `3.9.0`.

Our `package.json` file looks like the following:

```json
"dependencies": {
	"lodash": "~3.8.0"
},
```

When we update our packages, the `lodash` package will not update because we have specified not to accept a minor release using `~`.

In order to accept this release we will need to change the `~` to `^` like so:

```json
"dependencies": {
	"lodash": "^3.8.0"
},
```

The [npm server calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) is a fun tool to master versioning numbers and ranges.
