## The Problem

How can I convert a String to an int in Java?

## The Solution

The two easiest ways to convert a string to an integer in Java are to use `Integer.parseInt()` or `Integer.valueOf()`.

Here is an example of each. Note that both could throw a `NumberFormatException` if the input string contains characters that cannot be converted to an integer, so your code should handle this in a `try...catch` block.

### Using `Integer.valueOf`

```java
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String validString = "123";
        String invalidString = "123x";
        Integer number;

        try {
            number = Integer.valueOf(validString);
            System.out.println("Converted integer: " + number);

            number = Integer.valueOf(invalidString);
            System.out.println("Converted integer: " + number);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid integer input");
        }
    }
}
```

This will output the following.

```
Converted integer: 123
Invalid integer input
```

In the above example, `validString` is successfully converted as it contains only numerical characters. The `invalidString` variable contains a non-numeric character and cannot be converted, so we instead see the output from the `catch` block.

### Using `Integer.parseInt()`

The code below has only three differences from the previous example. We use `int number;` instead of `Integer number` to declare our variable that will hold the result, and we changed both instances of `valueOf` to `parseInt`. The output and other functionality are otherwise identical.

```java
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String validString = "123";
        String invalidString = "123x";
        int number;

        try {
            number = Integer.parseInt(validString);
            System.out.println("Converted integer: " + number);

            number = Integer.parseInt(invalidString);
            System.out.println("Converted integer: " + number);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid integer input");
        }
    }
}
```

## Choosing Between `Integer` and `int`

Modern Java versions running on modern systems are very efficient and there should be practically no performance difference between using primitive `int` and declaring new `Integer` objects, so you should consider convenience over performance in nearly all cases. Although initializing new `Integer` objects will take up some extra memory, this will be trivial unless you are keeping vast amounts in memory simultaneously.

Instead, you might consider factors such as:

* If you need to store the result in a database, then `Integer` is nullable which might be useful.
* `Integer` includes other helper methods, which you might need if you do further processing after the conversion.
* The primitive `int` can behave more predictably and manipulating `int` variables sometimes requires less code.

For example, consider the following:

```java
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "1000";
        String s2 = "1000";
        Integer n1 = Integer.valueOf(s1);
        Integer n2 = Integer.valueOf(s2);
        System.out.println("n1 == n2: " + String.valueOf(n1 == n2));
    }
}
```

Even though both `s1` and `s2` represent the same number (1000), this prints out:

```
n1 == n2: false
```

This is because `n1` and `n2` are different objects with different memory addresses.

Confusingly, the following code—which is identical except that it uses the value "100" instead of "1000"—behaves differently:

```java
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "100";
        String s2 = "100";
        Integer n1 = Integer.valueOf(s1);
        Integer n2 = Integer.valueOf(s2);
        System.out.println("n1 == n2: " + String.valueOf(n1 == n2));
    }
}
```

This prints:

```
n1 == n2: true
```

This difference in behavior is because Java caches smaller integer values for efficiency, so in the second example, both values are saved as the same object.

Using `parseInt()` and `int` primitives can avoid issues like this, giving you `n1 == n2: true` in both cases. However, using `Integer` has the benefit of the helper methods it contains and the ability to deal with null values.
