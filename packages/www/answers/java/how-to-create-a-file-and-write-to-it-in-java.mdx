## The Problem

How do I create a file and write to it in Java?

## The Solution

There are many different ways to write data to a file in Java, but the easiest way is to use a `BufferedWriter` along with a `FileWriter`, as follows.


```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String stringToWrite = "Java files are easy";
        try {
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("newfile.txt"));
            writer.write(stringToWrite);
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            System.out.println("Couldn't write to file");
        }
    }
}
```

This will write "Java files are easy" to a file called `newfile.txt` in the same directory as your `Main.java` file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

If you want to append data to an existing file, you can pass `true` as a second argument to `FileWriter`. This enables append mode, so the file will not be overwritten.

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[]args) {
        String stringToWrite = "\nJava files are easy";
        try {
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("newfile.txt", true));
            writer.write(stringToWrite);

            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            System.out.println("Couldn't write to file");
        }
    }
}
```

The code above will append a new line saying "Java files are easy" to the `newfile.txt` each time it is run.
