## The Problem

How can I use PIP to install packages from a local index on my hard drive instead of downloading them from [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/)?

## The Solution

Assuming we want to install the `requests` package from a local package index stored in `/opt/pythonpackages`, we can run this command:

```bash
pip install requests --no-index --find-links file:///opt/pythonpackages
```

The [`--no-index`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-no-index) flag will prevent PIP from accessing PIP, forcing it to search for the `requests` package in the URL provided to the [`--find-links`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-f) flag â€“ our local index at `/opt/pythonpackages`.

We can use these flags with any `pip install` command, including one to install from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links file:///opt/pythonpackages
```

If we want to install packages from PyPI or our local index instead of excluding PyPI entirely, we can remove the `--no-index` flag. PIP will install the latest version it finds.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --find-links file:///opt/pythonpackages
```
