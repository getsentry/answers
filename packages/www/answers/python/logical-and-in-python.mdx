## The Problem

What is the Python equivalent of the logical AND (&&) operator in an expression? This code does not work:

```python
initialized = True
fully_stocked = True

if initialized && fully_stocked:
    run()
```

## The Solution

Unlike Java or C, Python uses the word `and` to represent the logical AND.

```python
initialized = True
fully_stocked = True

if initialized and fully_stocked:
    run()
```

The same is true for other common logical operators. Instead of using `||`, Python uses the word `or` to represent the logical OR.

```python
initialized = True
fully_stocked = True

if initialized or fully_stocked:
    run()
```

Instead of using `!`, Python uses the word `not` to represent the logical NOT.

```python
initialized = True
fully_stocked = True

if not initialized:
    abort()
```
