## The Problem

How can I access the absolute path of the directory containing the current script file in Python? For example, if my script is `/home/user/scripts/runner.py`, I would like the output `home/user/scripts`.

## The Solution

We can do this using the special [`__file__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html?#file__) variable along with Python's built-in library for filesystem path operations, [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html). For example:

```python
import pathlib
script_directory = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.resolve()

print(script_directory)
```

The `__file__` variable contains the absolute path of the currently executing script. Following the example above, this would be `/home/user/scripts/runner.py`. Our code creates a `Path` object from this value and accesses its [`parent`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.parent) attribute â€“ this will be the script's containing directory. We then use the [`resolve`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.resolve) method to make it an absolute path.

The final call to `resolve()` is technically only necessary in Python versions prior to 3.9. Before version 3.9, the `__file__` variable could contain either an absolute or relative path to the current script, depending on how it was called. Since 3.9, `__file__` will always return an absolute path.
