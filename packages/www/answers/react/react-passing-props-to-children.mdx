## The Problem

You have a parent component that acts as a wrapper around other components. Can it pass props to its children?

Let's say we have a component called `RadioGroup` that has a number of children components called `RadioInput`, like so:

```jsx
<RadioGroup>
    <RadioInput value="first">First</RadioInput>
    <RadioInput value="second">Second</RadioInput>
    <RadioInput value="third">Third</RadioInput>
</RadioGroup>
```

The `RadioInput` component just renders an `<input>` element:

```jsx
const RadioInput = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        {props.children}
        <input type="radio" name={props.name} value={props.value} />
      </label>
    </div>
  );
};
```

To group `input` elements together, they must have the same `name` attribute. We can do it manually, like this:

```jsx
<RadioGroup>
	<RadioInput name="group1" value="first">First</RadioInput>
	<RadioInput name="group1" value="second">Second</RadioInput>
	<RadioInput name="group1" value="third">Third</RadioInput>
</RadioGroup>
```

But is there a way to add the `name` attribute programmatically by passing it as a prop to the parent component? For example:

```jsx
<RadioGroup name="group1">
	<RadioInput value="first">First</RadioInput>
	<RadioInput value="second">Second</RadioInput>
	<RadioInput value="third">Third</RadioInput>
</RadioGroup>
```

## The Solution

To pass additional props to the children from within the parent component, you need to clone the children components using `React.cloneElement()`.

The `React.cloneElement()` API clones an element and returns a new React element. The cool thing is that the resulting element will have all of the original element's props, with the new props merged in.

For example:

```jsx
const newElement = React.cloneElement(originalElement, {
  extraProp: "Some extra prop",
});
```

Here, `newElement` will have all the props from the `originalElement`, along with the `extraProp`.

In our original example, let's say we have the `RadioGroup` component defined as follows:

```jsx
const RadioGroup = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
};
```

You can write a function `renderChildren` and use it inside the `return` statement:

```jsx
const RadioGroup = (props) => {
  const renderChildren = () => {
    return props.children;
  };

  return <div>{renderChildren()}</div>;
};
```

Now you can loop over all `props.children` using the `map` function and clone each child with `React.cloneElement()`. While cloning we will add `name` to the existing props, like so:

```jsx
const RadioGroup = (props) => {
  const renderChildren = () => {
    return React.Children.map(props.children, (child) => {
      return React.cloneElement(child, {
        name: props.name,
      });
    });
  };

  return <div>{renderChildren()}</div>;
};
```

This way all the children components will have the `name` attribute set to whatever you pass to the `RadioGroup` component.
