## The Problem

How can I discard all unstaged changes in my Git repository?

## The Solution

We can do this using [`git restore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore). To discard changes for all files in our current working directory run the following:

```bash
git restore .
```

To discard unstaged changes for a specific file, run the following:

```bash
git restore path/to/file
```
