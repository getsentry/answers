## The Problem

After cloning a Git repository that has many branches, I can only see a single branch in my local copy. How do I pull all branches from the remote repository and have them show up in the output of `git branch`?

## The Solution

To create local equivalents of all branches in the remote repository, we can run the following bash for loop:

```bash
for remotebranch in `git branch -r | grep -v HEAD`; do
  git branch --track ${remotebranch#origin/} $remotebranch
done
```

This code loops through all branches in the remote repository and creates local equivalents for them. For example, when the script encounters `origin/dev`, it will create a local `dev` branch which tracks it (note the use of [substitution syntax](https://devhints.io/bash) to remove `origin/`). These branches will now show up in the output of `git branch` and can be checked out, committed to, pulled and pushed.

If we only need to view the remote branches, and not work on them, we can use [`git fetch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch) instead:

```bash
git fetch --all
```

We will then be able to view the repository state at each of these branches in [detached HEAD state](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head) by running `git checkout origin/remote-branch-name`.

If we only need to work on one or two remote branches, we can create and check out local versions of them manually using the following [`git checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) command:

```bash
git checkout -b local-branch-name origin/remote-branch-name
```
