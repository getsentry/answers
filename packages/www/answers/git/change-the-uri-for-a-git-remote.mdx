## The Problem

How do I change the URI of a remote in my Git repository?

## The Solution

You can do this using [`git remote set-url`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#Documentation/git-remote.txt-emset-urlem):

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git
```

Substitute `origin` with the name of your remote, if it differs, and the example URL with the new URL you'd like to set.

You can verify the change by running `git remote -v`, which will display the URLs for all remotes.
