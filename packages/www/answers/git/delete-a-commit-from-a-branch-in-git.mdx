## The Problem

How do I delete a commit from my branch history in Git?

## The Solution

We can delete one or more recent commits on the current branch in a local repository by following the instructions in [this answer about undoing local commits](https://sentry.io/answers/undo-the-most-recent-local-git-commits). [`git reset`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset) is the main command used for this operation.

If the deleted commit has already been pushed to a branch on any of our repository's remotes, we will need use the [`--force`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---force) flag the next time we push to rewrite its history:

```bash
git push origin my-branch --force
```
