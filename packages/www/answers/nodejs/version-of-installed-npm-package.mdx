## The Problem

Most modern JavaScript apps use a bunch of third party packages. Many packages are installed globally too.

How do you find the installed versions of the various `npm` packages?

## The Solution

All locally installed `npm` packages are listed in the `package-lock.json` file. For a smaller project, you can take a quick look at this file.

An easier way to find the installed versions of `npm` packages that doesn't require so much visual scanning is to use the built-in command `list`:

```bash
$ npm list
```

This command will print all the versions of packages that are installed in the current directory to `stdout`, like so:

```bash
$ npm list
projectName@projectVersion /path/to/project/folder
├── futil@1.69.0
└── lodash@4.17.21
```

If you want to see all the dependencies of manually installed packages and their versions, you can use `--all` :

```bash
$ npm list --all
projectName@projectVersion /path/to/project/folder
├─┬ futil@1.69.0
│ ├─┬ babel-polyfill@6.26.0
│ │ ├─┬ babel-runtime@6.26.0
│ │ │ ├── core-js@2.6.12 deduped
│ │ │ └── regenerator-runtime@0.11.1
│ │ ├── core-js@2.6.12
│ │ └── regenerator-runtime@0.10.5
│ └── lodash@4.17.21 deduped
└── lodash@4.17.21
```

You can also control the depth of level to show by using `--depth`. For example, using `--depth=1` will show the following:

```bash
$ npm list --depth=1
projectName@projectVersion /path/to/project/folder
├─┬ futil@1.69.0
│ ├── babel-polyfill@6.26.0
│ └── lodash@4.17.21 deduped
└── lodash@4.17.21
```

Notice that any dependencies that are more than two levels deep are removed from the tree.

If you want to take a look at globally installed packages, you can use `-g`, like so:

```bash
$ npm list -g
/path/to/node/v16.15.1/lib
├── corepack@0.10.0
└── npm@8.12.1
```

To find the version of a specific package, specify its name:

```bash
$ npm list futil
projectName@projectVersion /path/to/project/folder
└── futil@1.69.0
```

To check the latest available version of the package **on the npm repository**, use the `view` option:

```bash
$ npm view futil --version
8.12.1
```

Besides these, there are a few other options that can be used with `list`. You can take a look at all available options in the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-ls).
