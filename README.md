# Sentry Answers

[Sentry Answers](https://sentry.io/answers) is a place to get all of your technical questions answered.

`Answers` is supported via this open source repository, and when new `Answers` are merged to `main` here, 
they will appear live on [Sentry Answers](https://sentry.io/answers).

## Ask a new `Question`

Do you have a technical question that you cannot find a good answer to? Let us know!

Open an [issues](https://github.com/getsentry/answers/issues), preferrably using the template you will find when you create a new issue. Include context, language, environment, and any relevant information (e.g. other answers that weren't helpful and why). 

## Contribute a new `Answer`

Whether you have just helped answer a question for someone, just discovered something for yourself, or just
want to help some folks out, we welcome your `Answers`.

To get started:
1. Choose your question from the [issues](https://github.com/getsentry/answers/issues) on this repository, or come up with your own question.
2. Using the [answer-template.mdx](https://github.com/getsentry/answers/blob/main/answer-template.mdx) template. Include code examples when appropriate.
3. Make sure your name matches your name in your Author page. If you don't have an Author page yet, create one using the [autho-template.mdx]() and include that in your PR.
4. Open a PR with your `Answer` and make sure to include:
` Resolved #ISSUENUM` 
Where `ISSUENUM` is the issue that you are adding an `Answer` for if there was an associated issue.

PRs for new `Answers` are reviewed at least weekly. If the `Answer` is accurate and good quality, it will be approved and merged to appear live.
