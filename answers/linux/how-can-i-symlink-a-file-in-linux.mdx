## The Problem

How can I create a symbolic link/symlink/shortcut to a file in Linux?

## The Solution

A symbolic link (symlink for short) is a file that points to another file or directory. It is similar to a shortcut on Windows. We create symlinks using the `ln` command with the `-s` option:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/existing/file /path/to/symlink
```

Note that the path for the symlink's target is specified first, followed by the path for the symlink itself.

The `-s` flag tells `ln` to make a symbolic rather than a hard link. Symbolic links are usable across multiple filesystems, whereas hard links are not. For example, a symbolic link on an `ext4` filesystem (commonly used by Linux systems) can refer to a file on an `ntfs` file system (commonly used by Windows systems).

Note that the symlink will no longer work if the original file is moved or renamed.

To find out more about different kinds of links and the `ln` command, consult its manual page by typing `man ln` into your terminal.
