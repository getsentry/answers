## The Problem

Say you use the global jQuery variable (`$`) to check if a form checkbox input is checked:

```js
const isItemChecked = $('#itemInput').is(':checked');
```

And you get the following error:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
```

This is a JavaScript error that occurs when you try to access a variable or call a function that has not been defined. Why is `$` not defined?

## The Solution

The jQuery library attaches the global variables `jQuery` and `$` to the browser [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window). The `$` variable is the same as the `jQuery` variable; it's a shortened alias for simplicity.

When the jQuery library has not been added to your application, `$` will be undefined. Here are two common fixes: one for when you download the jQuery library from a CDN and one for when you get the jQuery library from npm.

### Add jQuery library script from CDN before your app script

The jQuery global variable `$` will be undefined if you import the jQuery library using a `script` tag that's added after the `script` tag for your application code, which uses the `$` variable:

```html
<script src="myApp.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.4/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

To fix this, import the jQuery library first:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.4/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="myApp.js"></script>
```

Be sure that the URL path to the jQuery library is correct and that the library is downloaded.

### Import `$` from the jQuery npm library

If you are using the [jQuery npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery), make sure that you import the jQuery global variable (`$`) before using it:

```js
import $ from 'jquery';
```
