## The Problem

You have a list where items can be moved by clicking and dragging. How do you change the cursor to look like a hand to indicate that the items can be grabbed?

## The Solution

Set the [`cursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) CSS property of the list items to "grab" using the `:hover` pseudo class selector:

```css
li:hover {
  cursor: grab;
}
```
