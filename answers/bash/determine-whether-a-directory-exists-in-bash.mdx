## The Problem

How can I determine whether a directory exists in Bash?

## The Solution

We can check whether a directory exists using the [`test`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(Unix)) command-line utility, as below:

```bash
if test -d /path/to/directory; then
  echo "Directory exists."
fi
```

Because the `test` command is used frequently in Bash expressions, we can write it as `[]` rather than typing out `test`:

```bash
if [ -d /path/to/directory ]; then
  echo "Directory exists."
fi
```

The `-d` flag tests whether the provided name exists and is a directory. To test for regular files instead, we can use the `-f` flag. To test for both files and directories, we can use the `-e` flag.

More information about `test` can be found on its manual page, accessible by typing `man test` into the terminal.
