## The Problem

How can I set a custom HTTP header on a request sent using [cURL](https://curl.se/)?

## The Solution

We can do this using cURL's `-H/--header` flag, which allows us to specify an HTTP header to be included in the request we're sending.

```bash
curl --header "X-MyCustomHeader: HeaderValue" sentry.io
```

If we need to add multiple custom headers to the request, we can do this with multiple `--header` flags:

```bash
curl --header "X-MyCustomHeader: HeaderValue" --header "X-AnotherHeader: Value" sentry.io
```

To confirm that our request looks as we expect it to, we can have cURL print it out by providing the `-v/--verbose` flag as well:

```bash
curl --header "X-MyCustomHeader: HeaderValue" -v sentry.io
```

The above command will show an HTTP request resembling the following:

```
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: sentry.io
> User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
> Accept: */*
> X-MyCustomHeader: HeaderValue
```

More information about cURL can be found by perusing its manual page, which is accessible on [the cURL website](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) or through the command `man curl`.
