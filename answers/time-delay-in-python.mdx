## The Problem

How do I make a time delay in Python?

## The Solution

We can do this using the [`sleep()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) function in Python's built-in [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) module. This function will pause execution by a provided number of seconds. For example:

```python
from time import sleep

print("Waiting 1 minute...")
sleep(60)
print("1 minute has passed.")
```
