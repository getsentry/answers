## The Problem

How do I extract a substring from a string in Python?

## The Solution

We can extract a substring from a string using Python's slice notation. The syntax is as follows:

```python
substring = my_string[start:end]
```

The variable `substring` will include all characters in the string, starting at the `start` index up to but not including the `end` index. Strings in Python are 0-indexed, so we must count characters from 0 to the length of the string minus 1. We can omit the `start` value to begin at index 0 or the `end` value to continue until the end of the string.

Consider the following examples:

```python
my_string = "Hello world!"

substring = my_string[1:5]  # will be "ello"
substring = my_string[:5]  # will be "Hello"
substring = my_string[6:]  # will be "world!"
```

We can also use regular expressions to extract a substring using the `re` module in Python. You can use the `re.search()` function to search the string for a specific pattern. The method returns a match object if a match is found. You can then use the `.group()` method on the match object to extract the matching substring. For example, to extract the price from a string:

```python
import re

string = "The price is $20.45"
match = re.search(r'\d+(\.\d{1,2})?', string)
substring = match.group()
print(substring) # will output 20.45
```

The regular expression pattern `\d+(\.\d{1,2})?` will match one or more digits followed by an optional decimal point and one or two digits, which corresponds to the price in the string. The `match.group()` method will return the matching substring.
