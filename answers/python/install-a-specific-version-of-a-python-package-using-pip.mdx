## The Problem

How do I install a specific, older version of a Python package using PIP? Will it matter if I have another version already installed?

## The Solution

We can install an older version of a specific package by using the following syntax in our PIP command:

```bash
pip install requests==2.30.0
```

The `==` syntax allows us to specify a version number. We can see which version numbers are available by looking at the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/requests/#history) on the package's page on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/requests/#history).

Note that, on Windows, the package name and version should be surrounded by quotation marks:

```batch
pip install "requests==2.30.0"
```

If a newer version of the package is already installed on our system or in our current virtual environment, we will need to add the [`--force-reinstall`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-force-reinstall) flag to uninstall that version first:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall requests==2.30.0
```

To ensure that future users of our project install the correct package versions when setting it up, we should create a requirements file. This is a file in our project's root directory named `requirements.txt`, which contains a list of [requirement specifiers](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/) (i.e. package names and versions) on which our project depends. For this example, our requirements file would have one line:

```
requests==2.30.0
```

We would then be able to install the correct version of this and any other packages added by running the following PIP command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Again, we may need to provide the `--force-reinstall` flag when running this command.

To avoid changing the packages on our entire system for individual Python projects, we can use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This is the recommended way to deal with Python dependencies in most circumstances.
