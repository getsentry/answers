## The Problem

How can you safely create a nested directory using Python?

For example, you want to create a directory called `innerDirectory` inside a directory called `outerDirectory`. But first you want to make sure that:

- The `innerDirectory` doesn't already exist.

- The `outerDirectory` already exists. If `outerDirectory` doesn't exists, then Python should create it.

## The Solution

From Python 3.5, we can use the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module to create, delete, and manipulate files and directories easily.

The `pathlib` module has several classes, but for the purpose of creating directories (and files), we just need the `Path` class. We can import it from `pathlib` like so:

```powershell
>>> from pathlib import Path
```

Next, we need to create a `Path` object. There are [multiple ways](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods) to create a path object. For our purpose, we will create it using the string representation of the required path.

Since the backslash character is also used to escape characters, it is best to use the raw string literal (the string prepended with an `r`) to represent the Windows path:

```powershell
>>> p = Path(r"C:\Users\username\projects\outerDirectory\innerDirectory")
```


If you are on a Linux machine or using macOS, your path would look like:

```bash
>>> p = Path('/home/username/projects/outerDirectory/innerDirectory')
```

We can check if the path, including the `innerDirectory`, already exists by using the `exists()` method. If the path doesn't exist it will return a `False`:

```powershell
>>> p = Path(r"C:\Users\username\projects\outerDirectory\innerDirectory")
>>> p.exists()
False
```

To create the `innerDirectory` we can use the `mkdir()` method:

```powershell
>>> p = Path(r"C:\Users\username\projects\outerDirectory\innerDirectory")
>>> p.mkdir()
```

Let's see what happens if the two checks in question fail.

### The `innerDirectory` Already Exists

If we use the `mkdir()` method while the `innerDirectory` already exists, we will get the `FileExistsError`:

```powershell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\pathlib.py", line 1173, in mkdir
    self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)
FileExistsError: [WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file already exists: 'C:\\Users\\username\\projects\\outerDirectory\\innerDirectory'
```

If we do not want to get the error, we can set the `exist_ok` argument in the `mkdir` method to `True`, like so:

```powershell
>>> p.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

The default value of `exist_ok` is set to `False`, which means that by default we will always get a `FileExistsError` if the file or directory we are trying to create already exists.

### The `outerDirectory` Doesn't Exist

If we try to create the `innerDirectory` without creating an `outerDirectory` first, we will get the `FileNotFound` error:

```powershell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\pathlib.py", line 1173, in mkdir
    self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\Users\\username\\projects\\outerDirectory\\innerDirectory'
```

If we want Python to create the missing parent directory, we can pass the value `True` to the `parents` argument of the `mkdir` method:

```powershell
>>> p.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
```

The default value of the `parents` argument is also set to `False`, which means that by default Python will not create a missing parent directory.

Using the `pathlib` module is the most robust way of manipulating files, and the tool we recommend. But if you are working with a Python version lower than 3.5, you may need to use the [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) module.
