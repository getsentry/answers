## The Problem

How can I convert a sequence of bytes to a string using Python?

## The Solution

We can do this using Python's [`bytes.decode()`] method:

```python
my_byte_sequence = b'Sample'
my_string = my_byte_sequence.decode()
```

By default, this method will assume that the bytes sequence is encoded as UTF-8. To convert a bytes sequence with a different [supported encoding](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings), we can provide an argument to `decode()`. For example, if our sequence is encoded as ASCII:

```python
my_ascii_string = my_byte_sequence.decode("ascii")
```

Note that if the byte sequence contains invalid characters for the specified encoding, a `UnicodeDecodeError` will be raised. In that case, you can try a different encoding.
