## The Problem

How do I get the last element of a list in Python?

## The Solution

In Python, we can get the last element of a list using index notation. A positive index will give us a position in the list counting from the start, whereas a negative slice index will give us a position counting from the end. The last element is at index -1.

```python
products = ["Apples", "Pears", "Oranges"]

last_product = product[-1] # will be "Oranges"
```

Note that attempting to access the last element of an empty list will raise an [IndexError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError) exception.
