## The Problem

How do I access the index when iterating over a sequence inside a for loop?

## The Solution

We can use Python's built-in [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) function to do this. For each item in an iterable sequence such as a list, this function will return a tuple containing the item's index and the item itself. Therefore, our code will look like this:

```python
products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]

for idx, product in enumerate(products):
    print(f"{idx}: {product}")
```

This code will produce the following output:

```
0: Apples
1: Oranges
2: Bananas
```

If we would prefer to start the index from 1 (or any other number), we can specify this using `enumerate()`'s `start` parameter, as below:

```python
products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]

for idx, product in enumerate(products, start=1):
    print(f"{idx}: {product}")
```

This will produce the following output:

```
1: Apples
2: Oranges
3: Bananas
```

The index can also be accessed without using the `enumerate()` function by iterating over the length of the iterable sequence as below:

```python
products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]

for idx in range(len(products)):
    print(f"{idx}: {products[idx]}")
```

This code will produce the following output:

```
0: Apples
1: Oranges
2: Bananas
```
