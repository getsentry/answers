## The Problem

When writing Python code, I sometimes need to split statements or expressions across multiple lines for readability. Considering that Python uses meaningful whitespace, how can I do this while preserving the meaning of the code? For example, I would like to turn this code:

```python
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Into this:

```python
sum = 1 + 2 + 3
        + 4 + 5
```

## The Solution

Python allows code within parentheses (`()`), brackets (`[]`) or braces (`{}`) to be written across multiple lines with arbitrary indentation. For example:

```python
sum = (1 + 2 + 3
         + 4 + 5)
```

This also applies to function calls and expressions:

```python
if (initialized == True and
    paused == False):
    run_job(1, False,
            "Hello world!")
```

List definitions, which use brackets, and dictionary definitions, which use braces, can be written across multiple lines in the same way and for the same reason:

```python
products = ["Apples",
            "Oranges"]

product_prices = {"Apples": 1,
                  "Oranges": 2}
```

Per PEP-008, using parenthesis, brackets, and braces is the [preferred way of continuing long lines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length). An alternative method is to use a single backslash (`\`):

```python
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 \
        + 4 + 5

if initialized == True and \
   paused == False:
    run_job(1, False, "Hello world!")
```
