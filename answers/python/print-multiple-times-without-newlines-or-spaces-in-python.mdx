## The Problem

Each time I call `print` in Python, a new line is created. For example:

```python
print("hello")
print("world")
```

This code will print the following:

```
hello
world
```

If I pass multiple strings to `print`, they will be separated by spaces. For example:

```python
print("hello", "world")
```

This code will print the following:

```
hello world
```

How do I avoid both newlines and spaces and print `helloworld`? In other words, I would like all new strings to be printed directly after the previous output, without any separators.

## The Solution

Python's `print` function takes two optional keyword parameters, `sep` and `end`.

* `sep`: a string to print between arguments. Defaults to `' '` (space).
* `end`: a string to print at the end. Defaults to `'\n'` (new line).

To prevent these extra spaces and line breaks from being printed, we can set both `sep` and `end` to empty strings, as below:

```python
print("hello", sep="", end="")
print("world", sep="", end="")
print("hello", "world", sep="", end="")
```

This code will print the following:

```
helloworldhelloworld
```
