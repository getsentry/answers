## The Problem

In Python, what is the most elegant way to check whether a string is empty?

## The Solution

In Python, [empty strings are considered equivalent to `False` for boolean operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing). Therefore, we can use `not` to check whether a string is empty:

```python
if not my_string:
    print("my_string is empty!")
else:
    print("my_string is not empty!")
```

Note that this will only work in contexts where we know for certain that `my_string` contains a string. The expression in our `if` statement above would also evaluate to `True` if `my_string` contained the boolean value `False`, or even an empty list. If we want to ensure that `my_string` is an empty string and not a different false-equivalent value, we should do the following:

```python
if my_string == "":
    print("my_string is an empty string!")
else:
    print("my_string is not an empty string!")
```

A string containing only whitespace would not be considered empty by Python. If our code needs to consider `" "` and `""` as equivalently empty strings, we can use [`string.strip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip) with no arguments to remove whitespace before making the comparison.

```python
if my_string.strip() == "":
    print("my_string is an empty string!")
else:
    print("my_string is not an empty string!")
```
