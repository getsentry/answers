## The Problem

Many imperative programming languages support a `switch` or `case` control structure, which allows programmers to specify an arbitrary number of alternative code blocks to execute, depending on the value of a variable or expression. For example (pseudocode):

```
switch (hour) {
    case 13:
        print("It's one o'clock in the afternoon, time for lunch.");
        break;
    case 17:
        print("The workday is finished!");
        break;
    case 8:
        print("Time for breakfast!");
        break;
    default:
        print("An hour of no consequence.");
        break;
}
```

Does Python have something equivalent?

## The Solution

The `match-case` statement was introduced in Python 3.10, providing an official version of this control structure for the first time. The variable or expression provided to `match` is tested against each *pattern* specified in an indented case statement.

We could implement the pseudocode above in Python as follows:

```python
match hour:
    case 13:
        print("It's one o'clock in the afternoon, time for lunch.")
    case 17:
        print("The workday is finished!")
    case 8:
        print("Time for breakfast!")
    case _: # equivalent to "default case" -- this will be executed if nothing else matches
        print("An hour of no consequence.")
```

The above code uses literal values as match patterns, but `match-case` supports a variety of additional, more complex patterns. Instead of matching literal values, we can use structural patterns to match an object's type or structure:

```python
match unknown_var:
    case str():
        print("It's a string.")
    case [int(), str()]:
        print("It's a sequence of two values, an integer and a string.")
    case {"Apples": 3, "Oranges": 2}:
       print("It's a dictionary containing at least two known key-value pairs.")
    case [_, _, _]:
       print("It's a sequence of three values of any type.")
```

There are also capture patterns, which allow us to save and use the value of the matched expression:

```python
match hour:
    case 13:
        print("It's one o'clock in the afternoon, time for lunch.")
    case 17:
        print("The workday is finished!")
    case 8:
        print("Time for breakfast!")
    case h: # the value of hour is stored in h
        print(f"The time is {h}")
```

We can even use structural and capture patterns together:

```python
def count_products(products):
    match products:
        case p:
            print(f"1 product: {p}")
        case p, q:
            print(f"2 products: {p} and {q}")
        case p, q, r:
            print(f"3 products: {p}, {q} and {r}")

count_products(["Apples"]) # will print "1 product: Apples"
count_products(["Apples", "Oranges"]) # will print "2 products: Apples and Oranges"
count_products(["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"]) # will print "3 products: Apples, Oranges, and Bananas"
```

Patterns can also have `if` clauses, called *guards*. For example:

```python
def count_products(products):
    match products:
        case p, q if p != q:
            print(f"Different products")
        case p, q:
            print(f"Duplicate products")

count_products(["Apples", "Oranges"]) # will print "Different products"
count_products(["Apples", "Apples"]) # will print "Duplicate products"
```

We can also use the logical or operator (`|`) to include multiple alternative patterns in a single `case` statement:

```python
match hour:
    case 9 | 10 | 11 | 12:
        print("Workday, before lunch")
    case 13 | 14 | 15 | 16:
        print("Workday, after lunch")
```

Further examples are provided in the [Python 3.10 release notes](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-634-structural-pattern-matching).

### Alternatives to `match-case`

Prior to the introduction of `match-case` in Python 3.10, the following alternatives were often used to emulate switch-case functionality.

#### `if-elif` blocks

```python
if hour == 13:
    print("It's one o'clock in the afternoon, time for lunch.")
elif hour == 17:
    print("The workday is finished!")
elif hour == 8:
    print("Time for breakfast!")
else:
    print("An hour of no consequence.")
```

#### Dictionaries with lambdas

```python
switch_dict = {
    13: lambda: print("It's one o'clock in the afternoon, time for lunch."),
    17: lambda: print("The workday is finished!"),
    8: lambda: print("Time for breakfast!")
}

switch_dict[hour]()
```

While this method is more syntactically similar to the `switch-case` statement in other languages than chained `elif`s, it cannot elegantly support a default case. If such a case is needed, the final line would have to be changed to the following:

```python
if hour in switch_dict.keys():
    switch_dict[hour]()
else:
    print("An hour of no consequence.")
```
