## The Problem

How can I determine a Python variable's type?

## The Solution

We can determine a Python variable's type using the built-in function [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type). This will work for built-in types as well as our own classes. Some examples are given below:

```python
my_integer = 1
print(type(my_integer)) # will print "<class 'int'>"

my_float = 1.1
print(type(my_float)) # will print "<class 'float'>"

my_string = "Hello world!"
print(type(my_string)) # will print "<class 'str'>"

class MyClass:
    pass

my_class_instance = MyClass()
print(type(my_class_instance)) # will print "<class '__main__.MyClass'>"
```

As per the Python documentation, the function [`isinstance()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) should be used when testing whether a variable is of a specific class, as it takes subclasses into account, which `type()` does not.
