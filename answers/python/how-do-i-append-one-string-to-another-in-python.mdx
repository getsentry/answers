## The Problem

Using Python, how should I append one string to another string and create one large string?

## The Solution

There are a few different ways to do this. The simplest is to take advantage of Python's operator overloading and add strings together, as below:

```python
firstname = "Jane"
lastname = "Doe"

fullname = firstname + lastname # will be "JaneDoe"
```

We can also use the `+=` operator to replace the value of our first variable with the combined string.

```python
name = "Jane"
lastname = "Doe"

name += lastname # will be "JaneDoe"
```

In many cases, we will probably want our two strings to be separated by a space, comma, or other separator. We can achieve this in a couple of different ways, shown below:

```python
firstname = "Jane"
lastname = "Doe"

# Adding three strings together:
fullname = firstname + " " + lastname

# Using str.join():
fullname = " ".join([firstname, lastname])
```

Both of these approaches will produce the string "Jane Doe". The second one uses [`str.join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join), a string method that joins the strings in a provided list, separated by the string it's called on. This approach is useful for combining large numbers of strings.

Yet another approach would be to use Python's [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings). This is useful for building more complex templates that we can slot existing strings into:

```python
firstname = "Jane"
lastname = "Doe"

full_address = f"Ms. {firstname} {lastname}, M.A." # will be "Ms. Jane Doe, M.A."
```
