## The Problem

How do I delete a column from a Pandas DataFrame?

## The Solution

We can do this using the [`DataFrame.drop`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) method:

```python
import pandas

# DataFrame with three columns
products = pandas.DataFrame([["apple", 1, 2], ["orange", 3, 4], ["pear", 5, 6]],
                 columns=["product", "cost_price", "sale_price"])
print(products)

# Remove the sale_price column
products.drop('sale_price', axis=1, inplace=True)

print(products)
```

This code will print the `products` DataFrame with three columns and then with two columns. We've used the following arguments in our `drop` method call:

1. `'sale_price'` is the name of the column to remove. We could also provide a column index (e.g. `2`) or a list of indices or names to delete multiple columns.
2. `axis=1` indicates that we should remove a column (`axis=0` will attempt to remove a row).
3. `inplace=True` tells the method to modify the current `products` DataFrame rather than returning a new one with the column removed. Without this argument, we would have to reassign `products` as below:

```python
products = products.drop('sale_price', axis=1)
```
