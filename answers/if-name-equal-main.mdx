# What does `if __name__ == "__main__":` do?

## The Problem

You may have come across this `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block and wondered what it is used for and whether you can use it in your own code.

What does this line of logic do? What are these variables referring to?

## The Solution

To understand what `if __name__ == "__main__":` does, letâ€™s take a look at this variable: `__name__`.

The `__name__` variable is set by our Python interpreter when we run our code and it's defined for each file.

If the file is used as the starting point of your program, then the `__name__` variable is set to `"__main__"`. If the file is imported, then the `__name__` variable is set to the filename without the `.py` extension. For example, if you import `some_calc.py`, then `__name__` will be `some_calc`.

We can use this `__name__` variable to allow a file to execute different code blocks based on whether that file is being run as the main program or as an imported module.

## Example

In a file called `file_one.py` below, three functions are defined and called:

```python
# file_one
def always():
    print("Always")


def on_import():
    print("On import")


def when_main():
    print("When Main")


always()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    when_main()
else:
    on_import()

```

The output of the code above, when run as the main program, is this:

```output
Always
When Main
```

The `always()` function is executed whether the file is run as the main program or imported as a module. The `when_main()` function, however, is executed **because** this file is executed as the main program.


In another scenario, a different file imports the file above, like so:

```python
# file_two
import file_one

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("file_two is the main program")

```

If this `file_two.py` is run as the main program, the output will be:

```output
Always
On import
file_two is the main program
```

Here the `on_import()` function is executed in `file_one`. This is because the else statement is triggered in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block, as `file_one` is not the main program but is executed on import.

The `always()` function from `file_one` is also executed, as it falls outside of the if-else statement and is executed whether `file_one` is the main program or imported.

Finally, `file_two` triggers the if statement of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block and prints.
