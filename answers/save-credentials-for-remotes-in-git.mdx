## The Problem

How can I save the username and password for a remote repository in Git so that I don't have to enter credentials every time I push to it?

## The Solution

We can use [`git config`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) to save credentials for remote repositories on a global or per-repository basis. First, navigate to the repository and enter the following commands:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
git pull
```

When prompted, enter your username and password. Git will store these credentials and use them for future pulls. The `--global` flag tells Git to store them in the `.git-credentials` file in your home directory so that they can be used for all repositories. If you would like to only use them for this repository, you can remove the `--global` flag.

Note that the `.git-credentials` file is not encrypted, so any usernames and passwords placed in it will be accessible to anyone with access to your user account on your device. To avoid storing user credentials, consider [using SSH for Git remote access](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-ssh-urls) instead of HTTPS.
