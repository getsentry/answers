## The Problem

How do I determine the number of elements in a list in Python?

## The Solution

You can do this using Python's built-in [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) function. For example:

```python
products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"]
product_count = len(products)

print(product_count) # will output "3"
```

The `len()` function works by calling the provided object's [`__len__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__) method. The `len()` function works with other iterable data types in Python as well, such as strings, tuples, and sets.
