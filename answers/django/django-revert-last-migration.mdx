## The Problem

You made changes to a model and made migrations, but you've realized it wasn't the right thing to do and would like to revert. How can you do that without making a new migration?

How can you revert the last migration in Django?

## The Solution

You can reverse a migration using the `migrate` command with the number of the previous migration.

Let's say you have an app called `recipes`.

You can see a list of all the migrations in the migrations folder or by running the following command:

```shell
python manage.py showmigrations recipes
```

You may have the following migrations in your `recipes` app:

- `0001_initial.py`
- `0002_recipepage.py`
- `0003_recipeindex.py`

If you want to undo the `0003_recipeindex` migration, you can do it like so:

```shell
python manage.py migrate recipes 0002_recipepage
```

You can shorten the command by leaving out the full migration name. Just use the migration number:

```shell
python manage.py migrate recipes 0002
```

Make sure that everything is working the way it should, then you can delete `0003_recipeindex.py`.

If you want to reverse all migrations for your app, you can use the name `zero`, like so:

```shell
python manage.py migrate recipes zero
```

Keep in mind that certain irreversible operations can make a migration irreversible. If you try to reverse an irreversible migration, you will get an `IrreversibleError`.

You can read more about Django migrations on the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/migrations/).
