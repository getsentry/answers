## The Problem

With the Django QuerySet class, you can apply filters that return QuerySets defined by your filters. The `filter()` method returns all objects that match the keyword arguments given to the method.

The following method returns all objects with the year 2005:

```
Entry.objects.filter(year=2005)
```

However, say you want to return all objects that are not equal to a keyword argument. The `filter()` method cannot make use of comparison operators, like `!` or `!=` to define a “not equal to” comparison.

So is it possible to exclude information using a filter? Or is there another method you could use?

## The Solution

The `exclude()` method from the QuerySet class returns all objects that do not match the given keyword arguments. So whatever data matches the parameter that is passed into the `exclude()` method will be excluded from the returned QuerySet.

Below is an example of the use of the [`exclude()` method](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/querysets/#exclude):

```
Entry.objects.filter(year=2005).exclude(color=blue)
```

The QuerySet created above will contain all objects associated with the year 2005, except those associated with the color blue.
