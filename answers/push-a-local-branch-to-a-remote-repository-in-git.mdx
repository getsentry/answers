## The Problem

How do I push a new local branch to a remote Git repository with tracking, so that I can use `git push` and `git pull`?

## The Solution

First, create a new local branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

Second, make changes and create a commit:

```sh
git add --all 
git commit -m "Added a new feature."
```

Third, [push your commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) with the [`--set-upstream`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---set-upstream) flag (`-u` for short):

```sh
git push -u origin my-feature-branch
```
