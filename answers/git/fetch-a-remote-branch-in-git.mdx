## The Problem

In my Git repository, how do I fetch a branch from a remote to start working on locally? There is no equivalently named branch in my local repository.

## The Solution

We can do this using [`git fetch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch) to retrieve the remote branch and [`git switch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch) to work on it locally. First, fetch the remote branch:

```bash
git fetch remote-branch
```

Then switch to it:

```bash
git switch remote-branch
```

Under the hood, this command will create a local branch named `remote-branch`, which tracks the version of `remote-branch` on the repository's remote, and check it out. We can then make commits, push them, and pull others' commits from this branch as usual.
