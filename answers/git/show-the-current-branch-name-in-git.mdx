## The Problem

How do I view the name of the current branch in my Git repository?

## The Solution

We can use [`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch):

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

The [`--show-current`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#Documentation/git-branch.txt---show-current) flag was added in Git 2.2. For older versions of Git, we must use the following command instead:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

Note that neither of these commands will work if the repository is in [detached HEAD state](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head), i.e. if you've previously checked out a commit that is not on the tip of any branch.
