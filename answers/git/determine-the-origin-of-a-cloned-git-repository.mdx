## The Problem

How can I find out which URL a local Git repository was originally cloned from?

## The Solution

By default, a cloned Git repository has a [remote](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) named `origin`, which refers to the remote repository from which it was cloned. To obtain the URL of this remote, we can use the following command:

```sh
git ls-remote --get-url origin
```

To obtain more information about the remote repository, such as its branches, we can run the following command:

```sh
git remote show origin
```

Note that this second command requires the remote repository to be reachable over the network but the first command does not.

If our remote is not called `origin`, we can retrieve the URLs of all remotes using the following command:

```sh
git remote -v
```

As remotes can be added, removed, or modified at any time, there is a chance that the remotes in your local repository may not include the remote from which it was originally cloned.
