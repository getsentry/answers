## The Problem

When I run `git pull`, the command fails with an error message indicating that local files will be overwritten. How do I force `git pull` to execute anyway?

## The Solution

The simplest and safest way to do this is by using [`git stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash). This command will save and store changes made to a repository's working directory since the most recent commit and return it to the state of that commit. From there, you can call `git pull` to retrieve remote changes.

To reapply the uncommitted work on top of the new commits, run `git stash pop`.
