## The Problem

How can I rename a branch in my local Git repository?

## The Solution

You can use `git branch`'s [`-m`/`--move`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#Documentation/git-branch.txt--m) flag to rename a branch in our local repository.

To rename the current (i.e. checked out) branch:

```sh
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

To rename a specific branch that may not be checked out:

```sh
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

To propagate this change to a remote, you can use [`git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) to push the new branch and delete the old branch, as below:

```sh
git push origin -u new-branch-name
git push origin --delete old-branch-name
```

If you're using Windows and would like to change only the capitalization in the branch name, use `-M` instead of `-m` to avoid an error.

```sh
git branch -M my-branch MY-BRANCH
```
