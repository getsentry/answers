## The Problem

How do I check out a remote branch in Git?

## The Solution

The `git fetch` command is used to download branches from a remote repository. If the repository has a single remote, running `git fetch` will download all branches. If the repository has multiple remotes, we must specify which remote to download from, e.g. `git fetch origin`.

Once `git fetch` has executed, we can get a list of all remote and local branches with the command:

```sh
git branch -a
```

In the output of this command, remote branches will be formatted as `remotes-/<remote>/<branch>` and local branches as `<branch>`. For example:

```
main
remotes/origin/new-feature
remotes/another-remote/new-feature
```

Once remote branches have been fetched, we can use `git checkout` as we would with a local branch:

```sh
git checkout new-feature
```

This will create a new branch in our local repository that tracks the remote branch.

If you're fetching from multiple remote repositories that have branches with the same name, a more verbose `git checkout` command will be required:

```sh
git checkout -b new-feature origin/new-feature
```

This version of the command explicitly tells Git to create a new branch (`-b`) named `new-feature` that tracks the remote branch `origin/new-feature`.
