## The Problem

How can I clone a branch on a repository? Is there a way to only download that branch?

## The Solution

We can accomplish this by using [`git clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) with the [`-b`/`--branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt--bltnamegt) flag. For example, to clone the `1.x` branch of `sentry-cli`:

```sh
git clone -b 1.x https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli
```

Once the repository is downloaded, we can check the branch by running these commands:

```sh
cd sentry-cli
git status
```

We should receive the following output:

```
On branch 1.x
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1.x'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

In the background, `git clone` will fetch all the repository's branches and then check out the one we've specified. If we only want to fetch one branch, we can add the flag [`--single-branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---no-single-branch) to our `git clone` command.

```sh
git clone -b 1.x https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli --single-branch
```
