## The Problem

How can I clone a Git repository into a specific folder?

## The Solution

The [`git clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command takes an optional second argument specifying the directory to clone into. For example, the following command will clone a repository named `monorepo` into a folder named `acme-monorepo`:

```bash
git clone https://githost.com/acme/monorepo acme-monorepo
```

Alternatively, we can create the folder `acme-monorepo` and use the Bash `.` operator to clone the repository into the current directory, as below:

```bash
mkdir acme-monorepo
cd acme-monorepo
git clone https://githost.com/acme/monorepo .
```
