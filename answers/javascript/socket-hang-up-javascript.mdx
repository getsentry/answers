## What are Socket Hang Up Errors?
There are two scenarios where socket hang up errors can occur. First, if there is no timely response from a server, then the error is thrown. Second, if the server has begun acting on a request, but the request is cancelled, then the error can also be thrown. 

For example, a user refreshing their page after waiting for a response, might trigger a socket hang up error because the original request is aborted. However, in this scenario, the error would not be critical because it is an expected action. 

## How to fix Socket Hang Up Errors? 
Because there are a lot of causes of socket hang up errors, there are a lot of potential solutions to fixing this errors which include: 
- Using the wrong HTTP/HTTPS server. Sometimes, having `require(http)` when consuming `https` can cause socket hang up errors. To fix this, change `require(http)` to `require(https)`.
- Ensuring you have an end to the request. For some requests, not having `request.end()` will also cause this error.
- Ensure your URL is correct. Having the wrong URL path could mean a mismatch which causes a socket hang up error. Make sure all the URL paths are correct.

### Framework-Specific Reasons
#### Next.js: Version
Some versions of Next.js and Prisma may be causing socket hang up errors. Updrading/downgraing to certain versions of Next.js and Prisma can help stop these errors. See the following [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51605) for more information.

Some versions of the Sentry Next.js SDK might also cause socket hang up errors. [Upgrading to `7.87.0`](https://github.com/orgs/vercel/discussions/3248#discussioncomment-7851868) should help solve these problems.
