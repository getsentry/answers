## The Problem

You may have come across a website page where the `href` value of an `<a>` tag has a value of javascript:void(0). What does this mean?

## The Solution

A `javascript:` URL prefix indicates to the browser that the JavaScript code following the prefix should be executed, instead of navigating to the URL. The [void operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void) evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`. By running `void(0)` in the URL JavaScript code, nothing is evaluated or returned.

A link that does not navigate to a new page or section of a page may be used to define empty links during development, but using an `href` value of "#" is a better option due to potential XSS vulnerabilities with the use of `javascript:` URL prefixes. This is further explained in the following article: [Which href value should I use for empty JavaScript links, "#" or "javascript:void(0)"?](https://sentry.io/answers/which-href-value-should-i-use-for-empty-javascript-links/).
