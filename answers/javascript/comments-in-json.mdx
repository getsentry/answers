## The Problem

Can comments be used in JSON?

## The Solution

The short answer is no. The [JSON specification](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) does not include comments, and they cannot be used in JSON files (i.e. files with a `.json` extension). Comments were removed from the JSON specification to prevent developers from using them to specify parser directives, which complicated the data format.
