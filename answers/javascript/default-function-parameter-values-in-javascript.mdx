## The Problem

Consider the code below for evaluating a home loan application. Applicants for the loan must provide their income and can optionally provide a deposit to reduce the total amount of the loan.

```javascript
const homeCost = 1000000;
const loanPeriods = 240;

function evaluateHomeLoanApplication(name, income, deposit) {
  const approvalThreshold = (homeCost - deposit) / loanPeriods;
  if (income >= approvalThreshold) {
    console.log(`Loan application for ${name} approved.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Loan application for ${name} denied.`);
  }
}

evaluateHomeLoanApplication("John Smith", 4200); // application denied
evaluateHomeLoanApplication("Jane Doe", 4000, 100000); // application approved
```

The first loan application will be denied, even though John Smith's income is enough to cover the repayment. Why does this happen and how can we fix it?

## The Solution

When an argument is omitted from a function call, it will be given a value of [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined). This causes our loan evaluation function above to attempt the following calculation:

```
const approvalThreshold = (1000000 - undefined) / 240
```

This will produce a result of [NaN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN), leading our code to deny the loan even though the `income` value provided is sufficient.

One way to avoid this would be to always specify a value of `0` for `deposit` in our function call. A better way would be to assign a [default value for `deposit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters), as below:

```javascript
const homeCost = 1000000;
const loanPeriods = 20 * 12;

function evaluateHomeLoanApplication(name, income, deposit = 0) {
  const approvalThreshold = (homeCost - deposit) / loanPeriods;
  if (income >= approvalThreshold) {
    console.log(`Loan application for ${name} approved.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Loan application for ${name} denied.`);
  }
}

evaluateHomeLoanApplication("Jane Doe", 4200); // application approved
evaluateHomeLoanApplication("Jane Doe", 4000, 100000); // application approved
```

Parameters with default values should be included after parameters without default values. Default values can include the values of previously defined parameters, as below:

```javascript
function submitLoanApplication(name, message = `Your loan application has been submitted, ${name}.`) {
  console.log(message);
}

submitLoanApplication("Jane Doe"); // will print "Your loan application has been submitted, Jane Doe."
submitLoanApplication("John Smith", "A custom message."); // will print "A custom message."
```
