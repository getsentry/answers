## The Problem

JavaScript developers often add the string `"use strict"` in their code. What does `"use strict"` do in JavaScript? What is the reason behind using it? Are there any benefits of using it?

## The Solution

The `"use strict"` directive enables [JavaScript's strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).

JavaScript's strict mode was introduced in [ECMAScript 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime. It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

### Usage

You can enable strict mode in two different ways, globally and locally.

Enable strict mode globally by adding the string `"use strict"` as the first statement in your file. All subsequent code in the script will execute in strict mode.

```javascript
// First line inside a .js file

'use strict';

// rest of the script

```

Enable strict mode locally by adding the string `"use strict"` as the first statement inside a function. Using strict mode locally inside the function will enforce stricter parsing only within the context of that function.

```javascript
// Inside a function

function strict_function() {
  'use strict'; // rest of the function
}
```

**It is important to note that JavaScript modules are in strict mode by default.**

### Benefits of Using Strict Mode

Enabling strict mode in your code has [many benefits](https://johnresig.com/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/).

Here are some examples:

**Prevent accidental creation of global variables**

Strict mode is useful in situations where you can accidentally create a global binding. Accidental global variables can create bugs in the code. For example:

```javascript
'use strict';

x = 9; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

```javascript
function strict_function() {
  'use strict';

  x = 'I am a strict function';

  console.log(x);
}

strict_function(); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

A common scenario in which you can accidentally create global variables is within for loops. With strict mode enabled, JavaScript will throw an error if you forget to add the `let` keyword before the loop counter variable (`counter` in the following example):

```javascript
function catchTheProblem() {
  'use strict';

  for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    console.log('Catch me if you can!');
  }
}

catchTheProblem(); // ReferenceError: counter is not defined
```

If you don't use strict mode here, JavaScript will create a global variable with the name `counter`.

**Catch typing mistakes in variable names**

If you don't use strict mode, a typing error can create a new variable, which can cause bugs down the line. For example:

```javascript
'use strict';

let misspelledVariable;

misspelleVariable = 9; // This line will throw en error due to // misspelling of "misspelledVariable"
```

**Prevent accidental deleting**

Deleting a variable, a function, or an argument will result in an error:

```javascript
'use strict';

let aVariable = 9;

delete aVariable; //This will cause an error
function testFunction() {}

delete testFunction; // This will cause an error
function testWithArgs(arg) {
  delete arg; // This will cause an error
}
```

**Prevent duplicating parameter names in a function**

Duplicating the parameter's names will result in an error:

```javascript
function test(arg1, arg1) {} // This will cause an error
```

**Prevent writing to read-only properties**

If you set an object's writable value to `false`, and then try to assign a new value to the object, strict mode will throw an error:

```javascript
'use strict';
const obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'x', { value: 0, writable: false });
obj.x = 9; // This will cause an error
```
