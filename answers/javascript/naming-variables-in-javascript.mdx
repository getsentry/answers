## The problem

How should I name the variables in my JavaScript code?

## The solution

* Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (`_`) or a dollar sign (`$`).
* Variable names cannot contain spaces.
* Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as `if` or `const`.
* By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
* Variables should be given descriptive names that indicate their content and usage (e.g. `sellingPrice` and `costPrice` rather than `x` and `y`).
* As JavaScript variables do not have set types, it can be useful to include an indication of the type in the name (e.g. `orderNumber` is obviously a numeric ID, whereas `order` could be an object, a string or anything else).
