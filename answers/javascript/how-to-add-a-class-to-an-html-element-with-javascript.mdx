## The Problem

How can I add one or more additional classes to an HTML element that already has a class defined? For example, I want to transform this:

```html
<p class="article-content" id="target">
  This is the first paragraph of my article.
</p>
```

Into this:

```html
<p class="article-content highlighted" id="target">
  This is the first paragraph of my article.
</p>
```

## The Solution

The preferred way to do this in modern JavaScript is by using the [`add()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/add) method on the element's [`classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) property. For example, using the HTML `p` element defined above:

```javascript
const myParagraph = document.getElementById("target");

myParagraph.classList.add("highlighted");
```

To undo this change, we can use the [`remove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/remove) method:

```javascript
myParagraph.classList.remove("highlighted");
```

Note that if the class to be removed is not present in the element's `classList`, this method will do nothing.

An alternative, more brittle method for achieving this is by directly editing `className`, which contains the string assigned to the element's `class` attribute. We could do this as follows:

```javascript
myParagraph.className += " highlighted"
```

Note that we've placed a space in front of our additional class to separate it from the element's existing classes.

Using `className` like this does not allow us to easily remove classes as we can with `classList`. This approach was more common in older versions of JavaScript, before `classList` was introduced, and should be avoided in modern code.
