## The Problem

When connecting to Postgres you might see this error: `psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket <some socket>`. This happens most often when Postgres' server daemon process is not running.

## The Solution

To troubleshoot this issue, first check to make sure that Postgres is running on the machine you expect it to run. You can use the `ps aux` command to make sure that the `postgres` process is currently running. If it's not, you will need to start Postgres.
