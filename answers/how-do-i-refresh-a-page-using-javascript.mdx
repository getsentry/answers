## The Problem

You want a page to refresh. You may want to do this to get new data after a user performs a certain action. How can you do this using JavaScript?

## The Solution

There are two [Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) methods for refreshing a page: `location.reload()` and `history.go()`. These methods are not part of the JavaScript language but are used with JavaScript.

### Using `location.reload()`

The read-only properties [`window.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) and [`document.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/location) (which is the same as `window.document.location`) return a `Location` object, which contains information about the current URL. The `Location` object has a `reload()` method that can be used to reload the current page. For example, `reload()` can be used to refresh a page using a "Refresh page" button:

```html
<button id="btnRefresh" type="button">
	Refresh page
</button>
```

The `"Refresh page"` button element is selected and stored in a variable. You can then add a `"click"` event to it:

```javascript
const refreshBtn = document.getElementById("btnRefresh");

function handleClick() {
  window.location.reload();
}

refreshBtn.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

The page is refreshed when the "Refresh page" button is clicked.

### Using `history.go()`

Alternatively, you can refresh a page using the [`history.go()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/go) method to load a specific page from the session history or to go backward or forward through the session history. This method takes in a single argument, `delta`, that indicates the position in history to move to, relative to the current page. A negative `delta` value moves backward in the session history, and a positive value moves forward. If you add no argument or set `delta` to `0`, the `history.go()` method has the same effect as calling `location.reload()` and the current page will reload.

We can replace `window.location.reload()` in our previous code example with `history.go()` like this:

```javascript
const refreshBtn = document.getElementById("btnRefresh");

function handleClick() {
  history.go(0);
}

refreshBtn.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```
