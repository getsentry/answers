## The Problem

You have a `div` element that you want to center horizontally in the middle of a page. For example, you want to center a `div` with a class of "item" horizontally in another `div` with a class of "container" that is the width of the page:

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item">horizontally centered</div>
  </div>
</body>
```

How do you do this?

## The Solution

One way to do this is to use [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox) and center the `div` item horizontally using the [`justify-content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) CSS property:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the horizontal `margin` of the `div` item to `auto`:

```css
.item {
  width: 100px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

When the margin is set to `auto`, the browser determines what margin to use. In this case, it centers the `div`.
