## The Problem

When you run the code below, Python will throw the runtime exception `TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment`.

```python
text = "hello world"
if text[0].islower():
    text[0] = text[0].upper()
```

This happens because in Python strings are immutable, and can't be changed in place.

## The Solution

The solution is to use one of Python's built in functions for string manipulation. In this particular case, `capitalize()` is what you'll need.

```python
text = "hello world"
text = text.capitalize()
```

Note that `capitalize` creates a new string and returns that new string. That's why we have to assign that new string to the `text` variable. In the example below, `text` would remain unchanged, and `capital` would have the result of capitalizing the `text` variable.

```python
text = "hello world"
capital = text.capitalize()
```
