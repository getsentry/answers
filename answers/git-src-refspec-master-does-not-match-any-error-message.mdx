## The Problem

When attempting to push commits to a remote branch with Git, you get the following error messages:

```
error: src refspec master does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to '<REMOTE_URL>'
```

## The Solution

This error message usually indicates that the branch you're attempting to push does not exist. This could happen if you neglect to create an initial commit on a given branch, after you change the name of a branch, or if you misspell the branch name.

To resolve the issue, first check the push command. For example, if you've changed the primary branch name from `master` to `main`, running `git push origin master` will produce this error message, and you should run `git push origin main` instead.

If you're trying to push a branch that hasn't been created yet, you should create it first.

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
git add .
git commit -m "New branch"
git push -u origin my-new-branch
```

If your branch contains no commits (check this by seeing whether `git log` produces an error message), create a commit before you can push.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
