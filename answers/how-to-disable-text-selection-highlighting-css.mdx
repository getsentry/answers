## The Problem

You want to disable text selection for some text. How do you do this using CSS?

## The Solution

You may have a `p` tag containing text that you want to make unselectable.

```html
<p class="unselectable">
  Unselectable text.
</p>
```

You can add a CSS class to it and use the [`user-select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select) CSS property to disable text selection by setting its value to "none":

```css
.unselectable {
  -webkit-user-select: none; /* Safari */
  user-select: none;
}
```

The `user-select` property requires a vendor prefix for the Safari browser.

You can also set the value to "all" so that all of the text is selected when a user clicks on the text. The browser compatibility of `user-select` can be seen in [this table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select#browser_compatibility).
