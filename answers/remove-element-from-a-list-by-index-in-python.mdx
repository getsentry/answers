## The Problem

How can I remove an element from a list by index in Python? In other words, how can I remove the Nth element from a list?

## The Solution

We can accomplish this using Python's [`del`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement) statement. This will mutate the list in place. For example, to remove an element with index 1, we can do the following:

```python
products = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"] # list has items 0, 1, and 2

del products[1] # remove item 1 ("Oranges")
print(products) # will print ["Apples", "Pears"]
```
