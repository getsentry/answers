```

## The Solution

Make sure the Android tools of the correct version in available. For example:

```flutter
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    buildToolsVersion '29.0.0'
}
```

In this case, make sure you've install Android Build Tools 29.0.0, otherwise Flutter will fail with the error above.
