## The problem

Flutter is a cross-platform framework, which means it can run on multiple
platforms. Most of the time we want our app to look consistent on all
platforms, but there are use cases where we&apos;d like to run different
code on different platforms, or render different widgets.

## The solution

### The mobile-only approach

The `dart:io` package exports a `Platform` class that we can use to check
the platform our app is running on. Letâ€™s import the `Platform` class:

```dart
import 'dart:io' show Platform;
```

The `Platform` class has boolean properties like `isAndroid` and `isIOS`
that we can use to branch our platform-specific logic:

```dart
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
	// Run Android specific code
} else if (Platform.isIOS) {
	// Run iOS specific code
} else if (Platform.isMacOS) {
	// Run MacOS specific code
} else if (Platform.isWindows) {
	// Run Windows specific code
} else if (Platform.isLinux) {
	// Run Linux specific code
} else if (Platform.isFuchsia) {
	// Run Fuschia specific code
} else {
	// Unknown platform
}
```

### The Flutter web approach

As we know, Flutter also runs on the web, but the previous solution
won&apos;t let us branch web-only logic in our app. There&apos;s a
different package that we can use to figure out if we&apos;re running
in web:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kIsWeb;
```

The `flutter/foundation.dart` package exports a `kIsWeb` boolean, so we
can use it similarly to the previous example:

```dart
if (kIsWeb) {
	// Run Web specific code
} else {
	// Must be some of the other platforms
}
```
