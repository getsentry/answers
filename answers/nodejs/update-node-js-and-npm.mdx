## The Problem

How do I update Node.js and NPM to the latest versions?

## The Solution

### Node.js

How you update Node.js will depend on how it was installed. If you've installed Node.js using a package manager, such as `apt` on Debian and Ubuntu or `brew` on MacOS, it will be automatically updated when a system upgrade is run. Otherwise, you may need to [download a new version from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The best way to manage different versions of Node.js is Node Version Manager (NVM). The [NVM repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/) has detailed instructions for installing and using NVM on Linux and MacOS. For Windows, [NVM on Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) is the best solution.

### NPM

NPM can update itself. Run the following command:

```sh
npm update --global npm
```
