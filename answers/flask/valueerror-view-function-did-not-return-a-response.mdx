## The Problem

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1836, in __call__
    return self.wsgi_app(environ, start_response)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1820, in wsgi_app
    response = self.make_response(self.handle_exception(e))
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1403, in handle_exception
    reraise(exc_type, exc_value, tb)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1817, in wsgi_app
    response = self.full_dispatch_request()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1478, in full_dispatch_request
    response = self.make_response(rv)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1566, in make_response
    raise ValueError('View function did not return a response')
ValueError: View function did not return a response
```

## The Solution

All Flask views must return a value, usually a [Response object](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#response-objects). If the flask view throwing the error accepts _GET_ and _POST_ methods, check if you are neglecting return a value for one of the cases.

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        model.save()
        # Failure to return a redirect or render_template
    else:
        return render_template('index.html')
```
